The broker would first collect all the trades in-house from all their local branches to a central location (usually New York).  For big brokers (and this is still true today), many of these trades could be canceled out in-house as well (if one customer wanted to sell 1000 shares, and another one wanted to buy 500, then the net amount the broker had to go buy was only 500 shares, because they'd just swap off between their customers). \n\nThen the brokers themselves would do the same thing feeding into the stock exchange floor (such as the most famous New York Stock Exchange).  The brokers would place their orders by phone or by wire (telegram-ish) to someone with a seat on the exchange.  Those guys would likewise first trade in-house and then contact their agents on the floor regarding any net sales remaining.\n\nThe guys inside the exchange house getting the call and wire instructions would then communicate via hand signals (and also by shouting).  Guys on the balconies would send signals to the traders on the floor. \n\nThen, finally the guys on the floor who were agents of the different brokers would group together in little circles divided up by industry, and trade with each other, bidding up or bidding down stocks in order to complete their sales.  For example one guy might say (using special verbal codes and hand signals) \"I offer to buy 10,000 shares of US Steel for $3 per share\" and someone else would say \"I offer to sell 50,000 shares of Alcoa for $1.45 per share\".  The largest companies might even have their very own \"pit\" with a group of guys just for that one stock.\n\nIf someone else was ready to sell (or buy) at the named price, they would signal back and each broker would write down on a card who they bought or sold what to, and hand it to a \"runner\" who would take the cards back to accountants who would double-check and then record the trades back up the chain, to the traders, and the brokers and then the stockholders.\n\nBefore any computers, the time needed to transmit all these communications and double-check all the records was enormous.  This is why banks and the stock markets used to be open only for limited hours each day (e.g. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \"banker's hours\") because the rest of the day and night was often spent sorting out what happened the previous day and getting ready for the next day. \n\nThis is also part of the reason why the stock markets still operate in units of \"trading days\" because it was often impractical for anyone except the largest, most sophisticated brokers to try to make money by trading on within-day fluctuations in price.  \n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeowCPwpRxM) is a video from the 1950s showing the system at that time.\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73k4cADaiO8) is a video of trading in the 1970s when they started to transition to using computers for parts of the operation.

Something I've seen since the first day of teaching is a fundamental self-serving bias. When a student does well on an exam, when they tell a joke that gets a big laugh, when they achieve anything positive, there's an immediate assumption that this can be attributed to their own efforts and worth. When they do poorly, however, the knee-jerk reaction is that the outcome was entirely outside of their control, and often that means blame falls on someone else or something else. \n\nFor me, this manifests as \"Mr. Willravel hates me\" or \"Mr. Willravel is out to get me,\" which brings all the parents to the yard. This allows the student and their parent to protect their self-esteem, to remain confident of their own worth and abilities, but ultimately it perpetuates a highly selective and biased understanding of themselves because it's uncomfortable to take personal responsibility for negative things or to admit that luck plays a big role in life. It's also a pain in the ass for me to deal with, but that's neither here nor there. \n\nWhile I do believe there are organized, monied interests who deliberately perpetuate myths about overpopulation which blame the failures of capitalism on poor people, I don't think that endeavor would be so successful if it wasn't for people engaging in self-serving thinking to protect their self-esteem from admitting that sitting in front of an expensive piece of electronics which uses materials mined by slaves inside their comfy homes which use 100x more energy than they need and eat food shipped from all over the globe from countries that can't even afford roads means they're benefitting from and contributing to the actual underlying causes of global shortage and suffering. \n\nI'm sitting in a home currently using a central heating system powered in part by fossil fuels on a laptop that costs more than someone in India makes a year and more than someone even in Portugal earns in a month drinking a cup of coffee that was shipped to my local store from Indonesia using polluting shipping vessels. It's incredibly uncomfortable for me to admit to myself that as I type this out I'm probably using 30x more resources than I should. Maybe more. My lifestyle could probably keep a dozen families alive if I used significantly less and we had systems which didn't place folks like me in wealthy countries above other people. \n\nIt sucks."}}

The more precision you get, the closer the value will be, but it will never actually be 0.1, it's always 0.999999something or 1.00000000something.  These values will be rounded according to some rules when they run on too long, so 0.1 displays as expected, but errors increase in magnitude when compounded as happens when you start doing arithmetic on the inexact values.\n\nCalculators on the other hand typically use BCD (binary coded decimal) to represent fractional numbers.  In BCD, each *digit* is represented on it's own, and on a modern system with 8bit (or larger) bytes, this means numbers up to some maximum length can be represented precisely even if they can't be expressed as a power of two or any other number.  The downside of BCD is that it's inefficient.  An 8bit value can represent one of 256 different numbers, so using it to store the value of a number that can only range from 0-9 is extremely wasteful of space.  One way this is addressed is with \"packed BCD\" which will use half of the byte, or 4 bits, to hold the value for a single digit.  Since 4 bits can still hold 16 different values, the range 0-9 is still covered, but you can fit 2 digits instead of just 1 in your 8 bit value.\n\nHope this was understandable!"}}

They\u2019ll photograph all the skin and visible areas, then they\u2019ll start looking internally.  They\u2019ll take blood and tissue samples, weights and measurements, and more photos.  In those cases, they\u2019re looking for what killed the person, how long ago they may have died, if they were in any sort of fight beforehand, evidence of sexual assault, weapon marks or fragments.  Tissue and blood samples will be screened for toxins and other drugs.  Pretty much anything that can help the police and DA determine how the person died and who, if anyone, did it.\n\nIf the death is one where someone just passed away at home or in the hospital, very often no actual autopsy is done at all.  The body just goes to the funeral home for embalming and preparation for burial.  Basic embalming involves draining fluid from the body and replacing it with preservative (embalming fluid).  Eyes and lips will be sewed shut, as will other body openings.  If the person died of a long illness (think cancer), efforts will be made using padding, make up and wigs to make them look more like they did when healthy.  A mortician can usually take a good guess as to why someone might have passed if they weren\u2019t at a hospital.  Things like internal bleeding, strokes or cancer are visible when they open a body to clean and embalm it.  So in the case of your father, if you already have the death certificate, 6 days after his passing, they very likely just went the regular embalming process without much of an actual autopsy.

How important either of these factors are for explaining any particular behaviour is a subject of much research and debate.\n\n**Genetics**:  Core programming or instinct that can become surprisingly complex stored in their DNA passed down through the generations.\n\n  The animal elicits a particular behaviour under certain conditions.  They shiver when cold, pant when hot, startle when they hear a loud noise etc.  These core behaviours evolved to increase in complexity.  For example, one species survived more when their startle response triggered them to run away from the noise immediately (deer), while others survived more by freezing perfectly still (rabbits), while others still just leap back out of range of the perceived danger (cats).  Evolved genetic behaviours can become surprisingly complex over many many generations.  Spiders web building for example (even though its simpler than it looks) in which they create giant concentric circles that get smaller each pass.  They just feel an urge to do something and don't necessarily know why (think hormones).  But even this complex behaviour started simple (perhaps by using silk to hang from things or rope slow prey they already caught in) and evolved into what we see today.\n\n  \n**Environment**:  Things learned over time based on their experiences.\n\n  Cold animals feel that their siblings/parents are warm and huddle up to them, hot animals feel the suns heat and try to hide from it in the shade etc.  These can also be taught by parents.  Beavers and birds are born and grow up in a dam/nest and so learn that=home.  When they are forced to move out they know they now need a home of their own.  They are taught the basics by their parents like how and where to find the building materials.  \n\n\nThis is where the debate comes into play.  A bird never actually sees it's parents building the nest they grew up in.  How do they know how to build it?  They start simple.  Pick up a twig and place it in a spot that looks similar to where their first nest was.  Does it look like the old nest?  No?  Better go get another twig... repeat until it looks/instinctively feels right.\n\nIn the case of Beavers they will start placing sticks in areas of shallow water as a bed/hole to sleep in like they used to.  However, they instinctively know to block running water by placing sticks where they hear leaks.  Research scientists did a study where they placed a speaker playing the sound of trickling water near a beaver's dam.  The beaver buried the speaker in sticks every time."}}

In Japan it was different. The Bow was a honorable and practiced weapons even for the nobility. Most Samurai were Mounted Archer. Their armor were also different as Japanese didn't have the same development in metallurgy as Europe to make plated armor. So Japan used shield as melee defensive gear for a longer time. Since they also faced more arrow than their European counterpart (generalization here it depend on the exact period and region), using shield to build fortification became more popular. Remember if you keep your shield on your arm, it's not really useful against arrow. But if you use a heavier shield and put at a certain distance in front of you, then it become useful.\n4. Japan took some time to adopt the firearms. For a long time, you had a mix of firearms, bow and crossbow on the battlefield. So those fortification were still useful, even if firearms were present. The Japanese were able to improve their fortification by adding straw in front of the shield (kind of like spaced armor) or covering the shield with steel. But it wasn't a practice that stayed frequent for long. Eventually, just like in Europe, shield became obsolete.\n5. In Europe since metal armor was already use to a larger extend, those were usually the answer to firearms. During the 15-16th century, full plated armor were used and as Musket become more powerful the European developed stronger plated armor, but they had to cover less of the body to compensate for the heavy weight and price. This is why you see less and less cover in then 16 to 18th century, eventually only Cuirasses with sometime helmet were used, even for heavy cavalry."}}

If you ribs are moving fine and your lung sounds are clear that's obvious very quickly, so you don't actually need to do a full inhalation, but the act of PREPPING for that inhalation gives us a lot of information as well, because we can see you set your chest wall (are you protect a part of your chest? if so why?) and if you're using your diaphragm properly in conjunction with your chest wall; if you're \"belly breathing\" with primarily your diaphragm that indicates that your chest muscles are either weakened or fatigued- e.g. the \"band constricting the chest\" feeling of an anxiety patient is actually just a muscle cramp of those chest wall muscles, and a \"stitch in your side\" is a similar muscle cramp in a different place. Since a big deep breath will usually cause people to use both their diaphragm and their chest muscles, we can assess the whole breathing apparatus simultaneously; but it's all in the setup, not the execution, so you don't actually need to finish that breath, just start it.\n\nThen if there IS something wrong with lung sounds, having that extra second to listen to it is very helpful for identifying say Rales vs Rhonchi, which are VERY similar sounds, but if it's obvious like wheezing sounds from anaphylaxis or asthma I don't need a whole breath for that."}}

It just didn't become the /dominant/ superpower until after WW2 when the other superpowers were busy blowing themselves up leaving only the United States (and later the Soviet Union as it skyrocketed in power) to fill the void.\n\nThe better question asked here is how did the Soviet Union - a nation bombed to hell and back in the second world war, one of the poorest nations in the world, come to compete with the United States and keep it locked in a state of cold war for 50 years.\n\n\n______\n\n\nEDIT: A lot of revisionism in these replies. I'm not going to respond to any of them directly and instead in this edit. \n\nThe Soviet Union did not inherit world power status from the Russian Empire as it largely destroyed the structure of the Russian Empire in the two revolutions prior to it becoming the de facto state in Russia. While some of the holdings of the Russian Empire carried forward as soviets, it was a largely different structure and the Soviet Union was still one of the poorest nations in Europe for the 20's and 30's, to turn around and be the primary military power in the second world war (the one that actually caused the most damage against the German Empire and who most of the credit to the war in Europe should go to). \n\nThe Soviet Union's rise is largely due to its centrally planned economy. By the end of the second world war the Soviet Union's growing pains of the 20's and 30's (read: mass industrialization, famine, political instability following the death of Lenin) were largely over. Immediately following the war the Soviet Union was able to stand toe to toe with the United States and its western allies (newly freed France, the United Kingdom, and its puppet states in Germany and Japan) and wage a 50 year long cold war that resulted in massive military spending on both sides.\n\nAnd the Soviet Union didn't 'trick' the US into thinking it was more powerful - the Soviet Union aided revolutions around the world. It beat the US in the space race by every single metric but landing on the moon (first satelite, first man in space, first space walk, first woman in space, first probe to another world, first space station, etc. etc.)\n\nThe Soviet Union wasn't perfect, but to claim that it was a paper tiger is just ludicrous. This is a nation that held the most widespread military power in the history of the world at bay for 50 years merely out of fear of engaging them in a hot war, and instead engaging in proxy wars and other cold conflicts through that period. \n\n[Here is a quick video by Prof Richard Wolf when it comes to the economics of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y-TWFKw4tU) to correct some of the misinformation below on the economic state of the Soviet Union (claims of slavery, etc.). \n\nAs for the other form of revisionism claiming the US wasn't a world power prior to the second world war - it is ignoring the history of the United States in central and latin America, as well as the pacific following the Spanish-American war. The American empire spread far and wide and it let its military might be known not only through the great white fleet, construction of the panama canal, but also the annexation of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, claiming of Spanish colonies (Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, the Phillipines, as well as Cuba which the US allowed to be nominally independent). The US also opened up Japan after centuries of isolation at gunpoint. \n\nThe US may not have been the most powerful power in the world after the Spanish-American war, but it was a strong enough world power to set its sphere far and wide and keep European nations out of its business for the next fifty years until they destroyed their own relevance in two world wars fought within their territory leaving the US to claim the prize. \n\nAnyone stating otherwise on either of these points has a very small view of the geopolitical state of the world for the 20th century, or is drinking too much cold war kool-aide which is now back in full swing thanks to the Russian Federation throwing its weight around and engaging in hot wars in Europe."}}
{"question": "Why are more exotic isotopes of hydrogen/helium preferred for fusion, so much so, that mining the moon is considered potentially easier than developing the tech to use regular hydrogen?", "prompt_source": "ELI5", "details": {"submission_date": "2022-09-12 20:18:04", "submission_ID": "xcsoh4", "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/xcsoh4/eli5_why_are_more_exotic_isotopes_of/", "flair": "Physics", "upvote": 243, "source": "data/original_data_collection/eli5_2022_myscrape/Physics.jsonl", "human_ans": "Fusing two atoms of regular hydrogen (hydrogen-1, aka protium, aka the kind most hydrogen is) is very hard. If you fuse two hydrogen-1 atoms, you get a diproton (aka helium-2), and unfortunately (or rather, very fortunately, as we'll see at the end of this post) the diproton isn't even *bound* (that is, it's energetically-favorable for it to just fall apart immediately), much less stable. It almost immediately splits back into two hydrogen atoms. \n\n*Very, very rarely*, in the brief moment the two can stick together in an excited state, the two protons can undergo beta+ decay and turn one of the protons into a neutron, producing deuterium (hydrogen-2). This is vanishingly rare, though, and it's the rarity of this decay that limits the energy production of stars. In fact, this reaction is *so* rare that we haven't been able to effectively measure it in the lab, and even under the conditions of the Sun, the average proton waits close to the Sun's entire lifetime to participate in such a fusion.\n\nOnce you *have* deuterium, on the other hand, it's pretty easy. Stick another proton on to make (stable) helium-3, then slam two helium-3s together to get one helium-4 and a couple spare protons (net effect: two deuterium + two protons -&gt; two helium-4 + two protons). The process of fusing deuterium into helium-4 is MUCH faster, because all the intermediate steps are stable. In the sun, each deuterium nucleus lasts only about a second before this next step takes place, meaning it's ~(9 billion years / 1 sec) = 280,000,000,000,000,000,000 times faster (that's 280 quadrillion).\n\nSuffice to say, 280 quadrillion times faster reaction rate is worth some effort.\n\n-----\n\nIt turns out that the slowness of the fusion of protons is critically important to the Universe. Without it, stars could be much smaller, and would burn through their material much faster. Moreover, a lot of the burning would have happened in the first moments of the Universe's history, so the available lifetime for stars would even lower, possibly to the extent that all available fuel would have been consumed immediately. Very few stars would have a lifetime long enough for life like we see here on Earth to evolve in such a universe. And as it happens, the strong nuclear force would only have to be very slightly stronger (a couple percent) for the diproton to survive, so this is quite a surprising level of precision on the part of the Universe."}}

Energy at a cellular level is provided by \u201cburning\u201d glucose to make energy carrier ATP (the technical term is aerobic glycolysis). Like normal burning this proces requires a lot of oxygen that is provided through red blood cells. If the exercise is demanding enough you require more ATP than your cells can produce with the supply of oxygen being a limiting factor. At that point your cells will produce extra ATP through a proces that doesn\u2019t require oxygen. Known as anaerobic glycolysis or the lactic acid cycle. This has lactic acid as a byproduct, which builds up in your muscles creating a less ideal environment therefore you lose strength. \n\nSo buildup of lactic acid due to insufficient oxygen supply causes your muscles to fatigue. \n\nThe reset happens when all the lactic acid is removed from your muscles and the ATP is again supplied through aerobic glycolysis.\n\nIf your muscles and stamina improve over time your muscles will improve blood supply and therefore more oxygen, giving you more clean burning to supply ATP. That is a reason some athletes take performance enhancing drugs like EPO which stimulate red blood cell production, delaying the build up of lactic acid in the muscles.\n\nFun fact; some organisms, like yeast, have a different anaerobic glycolysis system. When yeast is deprived of oxygen it will also produce ATP through anaerobic glycolysis, but instead of lactic acid the byproduct is ethanol i.e. alcohol. Therefore you have to make sure that when brewing beer or wine there is no oxygen coming into the fermentation vessel, otherwise the yeast will switch to the more efficient aerobic glycolysis and not produce any alcohol."}}

Cancer is an entire subset of diseases, not just one. A lymphoma treatment may be entirely different than an adenocarcinoma in the bowel. Even then can vary from person to person with treatments differing due to random chance and genetics (this is relevant in a study that I'll get to later).     \n  \nAdditionally, [the cure needs to also not kill the patient.](https://xkcd.com/1217/) Many cancers have a lot of overlap genetically, and physically with healthy cells. IIRC many of them can start off as normal cells, just losing the \"stop growing signal\" and then ending up in the wrong spots, like a mass from the arm sprouting inside lung tissue. So targeting them without also targeting healthy and vital structures is hard. It's killing a small portion of something that is mostly human, inside of the human, without also killing the human.     \n\nPart of this is why you see sensational headlines like \"new drug kills cancer!\"  \nOkay it may kill cancer in a petri dish, but does it work in rats? Monkeys? Does it do this in rats or monkeys without also killing them or leaving them with debilitating and unethical diseases?     \nOr even if it does pass all of these, does the drug only actually work on a small subset of cancers?   \n[This trial made the rounds of reddit a few months ago.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/05/health/rectal-cancer-checkpoint-inhibitor.html) Some cynics were saying \"guess we'll never hear of this drug again!!!\", even though it was 1, already a drug in common use for another cancer, and 2, how often are people keeping track of drugs that cure a subset of a subset of cancer.

It may work for more, but that would require further study, but for the time, that still leaves 90% of the other colon cancers, which even then only make up a smaller percentage of all overall cancers. So even if one treatment comes out and has \"solved\" a specific type of cancer, in a specific area, in a specific type of person, that's amazing but then it just becomes a treatment.

What prevents it from being implemented in real life is the lack of an infinite bankroll and the existence of table limits.\n2. It does *not* rely on the gambler's fallacy. It doesn't assume that the odds of any given play changes, but rather exploits the fact that any non-zero chance of winning becomes a guarantee on an infinite time line. At some point, you *will* win. And, when you do, your bets are structured as to cover all previous losses plus profit.\n3. It doesn't care about the odds of winning. OP already notes the odds are less than 50/50 (because of the zeros on the wheel). But the odds of winning don't impact the validity of Martingale, they just alter how long on average you might have to play to realize that guaranteed win. What *does* affect Martingale is the payout structure. For roulette, the odds are less than 50/50 but the payout *is* 50/50 (e.g. you win what you bet). This is why Martingale says to double. If the payout structure was different, you're subsequent bets would be different (better payouts mean smaller increases, worse payouts mean larger increases)."}}

Todd (1936 - 2014), published in *Scientific American* in 1977. Todd compiled previous research about feline phenotypes around the world (many of them collected by himself) and mapped the relative proportions of cat coat colours by alleles. Todd does not provide references in this paper, but previous articles by him and other authors give an idea of the methodology. In a study of cat genetics done in Boston, Todd sampled cats found in animal rescue shelters, experimental facilities, and veterinary clinics  (Todd, 1964).\n[Here is the map](https://imgur.com/HtRV6cg) in *Cats and commerce* obtained for the \"sex-linked orange allele\", which gives the phenotypes tortoiseshell, calico (both usually female only) and marmelade (orange). The remarkable thing about this map is its odd distribution with three disconnected geographical areas: Northern Europe, Eastern North Africa (and Sicily/Southern Italy), and Asia Minor. The fact that there is a drop off of the phenotype around Asia Minor suggests that the allele did not spread beyond this region by land.\nTodd also noted the higher presence in those areas of \"dominant white\" cats: he found this significant as white cats are both attractive and more fragile (reduced viability), which points to human interference, ie people chose to own those white cats and their presence was not random. Unlike the orange map, the maps of the other two alleles (non-agouti and blotched tabby) studied by Todd are relatively more contiguous: the blotched-tabby map is clearly centered on Western Europe and the non-agouti map goes from Morocco to the British Isles.\nTodd made the hypothesis that the orange and white cats had been transported by sea (hence their presence in coastal areas of North Africa) from an origin in Asia Minor to Northern Europe:\n&gt;Could it be that 1,000 years after they were introduced to these last outposts of European civilization cats still reflect what may have been aesthetic preferences of the Vikings? [...] The evidence suggests that the Vikings selectively transported this profile of sex-linked orange and dominant white from their contacts on the Black Sea and planted it in the North Atlantic.\nOf course, the idea of Vikings, of all people, being partial to orange kitties and petting them on their drakkars is fundamentally amusing, which certainly explains the lasting popularity of the concept. \nCats may have not been the only critter transported by Vikings: recent studies of mouse mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) have linked Viking travels to the dissemination of mice throughout Western Europe (Searle and al., 2009):\n&gt;It is our contention, therefore, that for the house mouse the Orkney mtDNA lineage represents a marker for Norwegian Viking influence. It should not be assumed, however, that mice with the Orkney lineage originated in Norway and were taken to the British Isles. The transport may have been in the other direction, but still made by Norwegian Vikings. Our results add to the previously described association between Madeiran mice and Danish Vikings, in indicating that house mice are a valuable proxy for Viking movements, as revealed through the studies of mtDNA. The combination in the Viking period of the spread of urbanization in northwestern Europe and the trade facilitated by sophisticated ships capable of travelling substantial distances and carrying large amounts of cargo make the Vikings ideal house mouse vectors. There is clear evidence from Viking-age deposits in Iceland and Greenland that house mice were indeed transported on Viking ships.\nAnother paper (Jones et al., 2013) on mouse phylogeography suggests that the analysis of cat and mouse dissemination can serve as \"bioproxies\" for human colonisation and demographic history. The authors cite the *Cats and commerce* paper, that they find \"intriguing\", but note the lack of cat studies done with molecular markers instead of the visual observations of Todd and his colleagues.\n**Sources**\n* Jones, Eleanor P., Heidi M.

In Ancient Rome, drinking wine was a sign of being civilized, with water and milk being seen as lowly and barbaric^(2). However, there is evidence that Ancient Romans consumed some grape juice, usually referred to as \"must.\" Virgil describes Roman women boiling down must to make a concentrated syrup, which wouldn't have been fermented and could be mixed with water to make a weak \"wine\"^(3). \nI couldn't find much about apple juice, but there is evidence people in antiquity enjoyed pomegranate juice.

However, it was preceded by millennia of urbanized Andean societies, some of which gained control over more land than the Aztec Empire did.

Thus a larger empire is more likely to exist after smaller ones have been established, and the size of empires in general will increase over time.

Author Pierre V\u00e9ron claimed that the Prussians had \"installed units of flying cavalry responsible for pursuing the balloons as far as they could see them.\" It's a single line in the article, and it seems to be derived from a equally short bit of news printed in the French newspapers since the 17 October, which was itself a translation from a dispatch by the *Times* correspondent sent from Berlin on 8 October that went like this:\n&gt; Balloons are daily sent off from Paris, and are carried by the prevailing easterly winds to the provinces which are unoccupied by the Germans. They are followed by light cavalry as long as they continue in sight. \nThe line by V\u00e9ron about the Prussians having put special cavalry units in place to chase the balloons seems to be a slight exaggeration, made to push his point that the Prussians were desperate to capture the balloons, and that it was necessary to enforce operational security, and if possible to send the balloons at night (which was eventually done). \nNote that when the *Times* dispatch was written on 8 October, only 7 balloons had been sent. We do have a direct testimony about a close encounter with the Prussian calvalry, told by aeronaut Gaston Tissandier, who flew the *C\u00e9leste* on 30 September 1870 (it was the fourth flight).\nDeparting from the gas factory of Vaugirard at 9-10 am, Tissandier was flying westward, reaching 1800 m. When he was above the palace of Versailles, he saw German officers below looking at him with spyglasses. He dumped a packet of 1000 anti-German propaganda flyers (the *proclamations*) on them, and flew over a German camp, where he was shot at (he dumped another packet of flyers). Over the Hourdan forest, his balloon started leaking gas:\n&gt; I quickly grab a ballast bag and empty it overboard, but my barometer tells me that I am still descending; the cold penetrates me to the bones. The balloon quickly reaches altitudes of 1000 metres, 800 metres, 600 metres. It descends again. I successively empty three bags of ballast to keep my balloon at only 500 metres above the forest, because it refuses to go any higher.\n&gt; At this moment, I hover over a crossroads. A group of men is gathered there. Great God! they are Prussians. Here are others; uhlans, cavalrymen are riding along the paths. I have only a bag of ballast left. I launch my last packet of *proclamations* into space. But the balloon has lost a lot of gas, through solar dilation and through its leaks; it is cooled, its ascensional force is singularly diminished.\n&gt; I am only 420 metres high, a bullet could well hit me.\n&gt; Fortunately for me the wind is strong; I fly like an arrow over the trees; the uhlans look at me astonished, and see me pass without any rifle shot threatening me. I continue my route above green meadows, gracefully framed by hawthorn hedges.\nTissandier landed safely in Dreux at about 11-12 am.\nAs the balloons flew too high to be shot down by rifles, unless they lost altitude by accident as almost had happened to Tissandier, the Prussians developed the first anti-aircraft weapon, Krupp's *Ballonabwehrkanone* or BaK ([shown here in Tissandier's book](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3412201j/f121.item)), a 37-millimeter breech-loading cannon mounted to the bed of a carriage (so it was also the first \"technical\", more than a century before the Toyota Hilux!). According to Tissandier, this *mousquet \u00e0 ballons* was installed in Versailles, where it was paraded \"triumphantly\" in the streets. As soon as spotters saw a ballon rising above Paris, the news was transmitted by telegraph to Versailles and the horse-drawn gun was moved as fast as possible to a position where an experienced artilleryman could try to shoot the balloon. Tissandier says that many French aeronauts heard projectiles whizzing by at altitudes as high as 800 to 1000 m. The *Daguerre* was brought down and captured by a Prussian cavalry unit on 12 November 1870, though the French Army later believed that it was shot by rifles, not by the *mousquet \u00e0 ballons* (Dufaux, 1886). In any case, German attempts to shoot the balloons out of the sky were not very successful, and did not prevent the transmission of several [millions of messages](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5499951n) from and to Paris. Out of the 64-67 balloons that left Paris during the war, only 5 were downed and captured by the Prussians. So: even if the Prussians did not have special cavalry units to capture balloons, they invented anti-aircraft warfare to shoot them.\n**Sources**\n* The Illustrated London News. \u2018The War\u2019, 15 October 1870. https://books.google.fr/books?id=o3YNN6EB_B0C&amp;pg=PA390\n* Dufaux, Capitaine. \u2018Tir contre les ballons\u2019.

While a Vulgar Latin dialect existed, it died out 300 years after the Romans left. Why did British Latin die out while many other languages were able to survive?\nWhile it was said that invasions destroyed the language, I don't see that happening for other countries. France for example was invaded by the Franks who established a kingdom there and adopted the local dialect of the region they settled on. Even Romania, which had been under Roman rule from 106 AD - 275 AD, only 169 years spoke a Romance language.\nWith such a long period of Roman rule, why didn't the people in Britain speak a Romance language?

Why didn't the Anglo-Saxons adopt the culture of the Romans as the Franks did?\nThe British isles experienced marked demographically changes following the separation from Rome at the beginning of the 5th century. The economy declined and became more locally orientated, with cities decreasing in size and population, occasionally even being abandoned outright. Food production suffered as a result of a Little Ice Age in Late Antiquity and in the South of England, a significant portion of the native Brittonic speakers (likely an elite of sorts) left Britain for the European mainland during this period. These Britons settled in what is now Brittany (hence the name) and their language lives on, in France,  in the form of Breton. In addition to all this, the so-called Plague of Justinian (probably a strain of Bubonic Plague) also arrived in Britain during the half of the 6th century as well, killing large numbers of people. Exact figures for England are impossible to give, but this pandemic is often estimated to have killed between 20 to 50% of Europe's population as a whole and would have hit the more densely populated cities far harder than the countryside.\nAll in all, 5th and 6th century Britain was noticeably less densely populated, less urbanized, less organised and more fragmented than it had been some two centuries earlier while still under Roman rule. Generally speaking, when discussing Post-Migration Period Europe, a pattern tends to emerge. In which the more densely populated and more organised areas (i.e. with relatively much of the urban infrastructure remaining) tend to assimilate the languages of the Germanic invaders.\nFrance / Gaul makes for an interesting comparison:\n* Northern Gaul (Belgium and the Southern Netherlands) found itself into a similar situation to sub-Roman Britain: it had few still functioning cities (and those that still existed, were small) in addition to a low(er) population figure owing to various past conflicts and invasions in the area. Today, this area is Dutch-speaking, a Germanic language.\n* Southern Gaul survived the Migration Period relatively unscathed. Its cities, while decreasing in size, had largely survived and had retained their elites as well as ecclesial infrastructure. It remained Romance-speaking; even retaining a dialect (Occitan) which shows significantly less loanwords from Germanic languages than French (proper) does.\n* Central Gaul (between the Somme and the Loire) was kind of in between. The Franks settled the area north of the Seine River and their elites controlled the land as a whole, but in the end; after some 4 centuries, they assimilated. Most likely after already having been bilingual for quite some time.  Today this part of France is, with the exception of Brittany, Romance-speaking.\nThe exact process of language shift in England is not completely known, nor is the extent to which Romano-British was spoken in Britain prior to Germanic settlement. Regardless of how widely spoken or understood British Romance was, it does appear that the British countryside retained its pre-Roman (Celtic/Brittonic) languages to a higher degree than that of Hispania or Gaul. Given that at the very most 25-30% of Roman society lived in or near a city, the Celtic-speakers would have likely outnumbered the total number of British Romance speakers, especially when considering that the degree of urbanization in a far away corner of the empire would have been lower than the aforementioned average, which also includes Italy, Greece and the Eastern Provinces.\nModern scholars tend to explain the language shift from Celtic/Romance to Germanic as follows: Brittonic / Romance -speakers came under the influence of small Germanic warrior elites; whose dialects (being the ones with the most political power) were considered more prestigious, promoting bilingualism. In the case of British Romance-speakers, they might have already been in the process of shifting (back) to Celtic dialects at this point. Political power seems to have been the primary determinant of the superior prestige of Germanic dialects, as the native Britons do not seem to have had much of a technological or organisational edge over the Germanic settlers. The fragmented nature of the post-Roman fiefdoms strengthened the position of Germanic dialects in Southeastern England from which they continually expanded.\nOver time, the less prestigious Celtic and/or Romance languages would cease to be spoken. This hypothesis also assumes, that the first to become bilingual would have been the remaining British elites, due to them having most to gain from political and economic ties to the Germanic warlords. Acting as intermediaries, these people would have been the true facilitators of the spread of the various Germanic dialects.\nGenetics seems to support this (as there seems to be no genetic evidence for a Celtic genocide in England) as do the etymologies of the names of various early 'Anglo-Saxon' rulers, which are clearly Celtic in origin. Language shifts like this can happen over the course of a few generations and could have been caused by a surprisingly small group of Germanic speakers.\nSome small side-notes to your question:\n&gt;Even Romania, which had been under Roman rule from 106 AD - 275 AD, only 169 years spoke a Romance language.\nIt is unclear if Romania remained Romance-speaking following the Roman withdrawal from the area. There are strong archaeological and linguistic indicators, that Dacia / Romania was initially depopulated and later resettled by groups of Romance-speakers not native to Dacia, but originating from the Balkans.\n**TLDR:**\nSubroman Britain was already politically and economically weakened when the first Germanic settlers arrived. The Anglo-Saxons formed a warrior elite, whose language was more prestigious; encouraging bilingualism and eventually monolingualism among the native Britons.\n***Sources / Additional reading:***\n* Linguarum Diversitas: Latin and the Vernaculars in Early Medieval Britain, by D.

Louis-Napol\u00e9on was not his uncle: all he had was money, a name, and some grumpy friends. He also had little military experience, having only briefly participed with his brother to an insurrection in Italy early 1831 (both brothers caught measles and Napol\u00e9on-Louis died of it). He did not even know France: at 32, he had lived in exile since he was 8, wandering around Europe with his parents.\nIn Strasbourg in 1836, and in Boulogne in 1840, Louis-Napol\u00e9on tried to replicate the *Vol de l'Aigle* of his uncle, the \"Flight of the Eagle\", the triumphant and legendary return of Napol\u00e9on to power in March 1815, after his exile to Elba. It had taken a mere 19 days for the Emperor to reach Paris, his initial group of 1200 men growing into an army of 14,000 or so as royal troops defected to him along the way, all of this without firing a single shot, per orders of Napol\u00e9on. Louis-Napol\u00e9on imagined that he could do the same: he would arrive in a supposedly Napol\u00e9on-friendly place with a group of partisans, convince the local garrison to rally him and then he would ride to Paris, his army swelling with royal troops turned bonapartist, and there would be thousands of French people lining the streets and shouting \"Vive l'Empereur\", and he would become Emperor Napol\u00e9on.\nThe Strasbourg coup attempt of 1836 finished as soon as it started, when the officers commanding the garrison refused to join him and his little band of rebels: Louis-Napol\u00e9on was arrested and kicked out of France (he went to America). \nFour years later, the Boulogne coup was a little better organized, but not that much. Notably, Louis-Napol\u00e9on had contact with military officers in France who may have offered him support, though, given the final result, this support was greatly exaggerated. Louis-Napol\u00e9on departed from London with a little more than 50 men: 20 of them were personal friends, retired and embittered officers, and domestics (who were left in the dark about the whole affair), and the rest were French and Polish men that he had recruited in London. Those should have been all ex-military but the conspirators had not put \"military experience required\" in their recruitment drive, fearing leaks (and there was actually an informer in the group). Louis-Napol\u00e9on had chartered a steamboat, the *Edinburgh Castle*, and he collected the members of his little invasion party at different stopovers to avoid detection. They had 9 horses, two carriages, crates of guns, food, wine, rolls of coins, and uniforms that had been made in London. The group left Britain for France on 5 August. Once they were at sea, Louis-Napol\u00e9on gave them a pep talk (\"in a few days we will be in Paris\"). The plan was to capture Boulogne and rally the 42nd Infantry Regiment (this would take 4 hours), and move from town to town collecting friendly troops until Louis-Napol\u00e9on arrived triumphantly in Paris. Like Napol\u00e9on after Elba, he told the men that the coup had to be bloodless. Like Napol\u00e9on, he had written and had printed in advance grandiose declarations for the populations and for the army. \nAnd then the weather got stormy and a few men got sick on the boat. Were they drunk? Yes, according to James Crow, the captain of the *Edinburgh Castle*, who was interrogated afterwards:\n&gt;Q. Did you notice that these gentlemen drank during the last few hours that they were on board?\n&gt;A. They drank a great deal, and I have never seen them drink more\nthan they did, and of all kinds of wine.\nThe Prefect of the Pas-de-Calais, in his report, also said:\n&gt;Several stops were made, and it seems certain that in one of them copious libations of Champagne wine and brandy were made by the insurgents.\n&gt;The captain of the boat told us that the rebels had drunk sixteen dozen bottles of wine on their way from London to Wimereux, not counting brandy and liquor. The soldiers of the 42nd who were present at the action, whom we interviewed, assured us that the rebels were almost all drunk.\nFor historian Adrien Dansette (1958), however, the captain's claim was that of a \"furious sailor\" pissed off after seeing his boat hijacked by the conspirators. As for the Prefect's report, it was in the best interest of the authorities to present the conspirators as a bunch of crazy drunks.\nThe invading group disembarked on the night of 5 and 6 August in Wimereux, a little harbour north of Boulogne, where they were joined by fellow plotters, notably Lieutenant Aladenize, from the 42nd. They came upon a customs patrol that they tried to rally to the cause, or at least bribe. The employees refused and were taken hostage (non-violently). The party, now in full military dress, walked to the garrison. They met an officer on the way, Lieutenant de Maussion, and Louis-Napol\u00e9on told him \"that he had come to restore the humiliated France to its rightful place\". The puzzled Maussion ran away to warn his commander, Captain Col-Puygellier. Meanwhile, the plotters entered the garrison and Aladenize started talking to the soldiers. The conspirators promised to name them officers, and urged them to shout \"Vive l'Empereur\", which some did. Outside the garrison, some plotters distributed coins to passerbys, also telling them to shout pro-Napol\u00e9on slogans. De Maussion returned and refused to rally the rebels. Col-Puygellier arrived in turn and some of the plotters tried to block him. Louis-Napol\u00e9on asked him to join the coup. Col-Puygellier refused, shouted to his men \"Vive le Roi\", cried for help, and told Louis-Napol\u00e9on and his men to leave. Other officers arrived, a scuffle ensued, with Aladenize trying to prevent violence. This is when the Prince shot his gun, hitting grenadier Joseph Geoffroy (31, a married man) in the mouth. Col-Puygellier later told in his report that Louis-Napol\u00e9on had shot him deliberately, but he did not repeat this claim at the trial, just saying that he had heard a shot. Geoffroy, who was not gravely wounded, just confirmed the sequence of events when he was interrogated by the judges. Louis-Napol\u00e9on expressed his regret of \"having wounded a French soldier\" and that he was happy that nothing more serious had happened. The Prince claimed that it was an accident:\n&gt;There are times when you can't be aware of your intentions. When I saw the commotion start, I took my gun. It went off without my meaning to point it at anyone.\nIn any case, the shot resulted in the rebels fleeing from the garrison. They tried to get into the city, without success as the doors were closed, and then walked to the Colonne de la Grande Arm\u00e9e, a monument dedicated to Napol\u00e9on's army. They forced the guard to open the door at gunpoint, hoping to raise a flag on top of the column. Louis-Napol\u00e9on allegedly said \"This is where I want to die\". But the rebels were now pursued by the men of the 42nd, by the gendarmes and by national guards, so they left the Colonne and ran to the shore, where they expected to find the steamboat. Instead, there was only a small bark, and Louis-Napol\u00e9on and his friends started swimming. Their pursuers shot at them (one later said that \"it was like a duck hunt\"), killing three and wounding one seriously. Louis-Napol\u00e9on was grazed by a bullet. The survivors were arrested, and Louis-Napol\u00e9on thrown in prison. The coup was mocked on both sides of the Channel, with the Prince called a fool, a \"ridiculous maniac\" (*The Morning Post*) and a \"mischivious blockhead\" (*The Times*). Louis-Napol\u00e9on was emprisoned for six years before escaping.\nSo, as far as coups go, this was really amateur hour. Napol\u00e9on's nephew seriously believed that his time had come, and that his name alone would be enough to make the French rally him on the spot, like they had rallied the Emperor after Elba. But Napol\u00e9on had planned very carefully his itinerary from Provence to Paris to avoid royalist hotspots during the \"flight\": his nephew, for the second time, had showed up at the door of military barracks that looked promising, tried to have the soldiers join him, but the commanding officers had been loyal to the King and arrested him and his men. It would take a few years of prison for Louis-Napol\u00e9on to mature a little bit and formulate a plan that could actually work.\nNote: many of the testimonies about the Boulogne coup have been collected and published by Albert Ferm\u00e9 in 1869 (see below).\n**Sources**\n* Anceau, Eric.

The Klan played on their religious convictions and phobias about immigration, eventually winning public office and instituting effectively a \"Klan state.\"*\nIn the first half of the 19th c., poor whites mostly from VA and KY were pushed west to Ohio and Indiana. Scots-Irish, they were largely Baptist, anti-Catholic, and intensely rural. Their motives were largely economic. Contest for cheap land became a bitter one as \"Yankee\" New Englanders also moved to take advantage of low land prices. These were other Protestants, such as northern Presbyterians, many of whom were abolitionists. They could afford more acreage and invest more in their farms and ranches, pushing their poorer neighbors further into southwest Indiana and painting the northern and eastern parts of the state more Union-friendly than they had initially been. This proceeded through the Civil War.\n**This is to say that the stage was already set** with poor, anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant white families originally from border states who were hostile to wealthier \"Yankees,\" ticking all the boxes to attract Klan advertisement.\nIndiana, itself, was not \"solidly loyal\" to the Union. There were several proposals to protect and even reinstate slavery which fell through, but nevertheless had moderate support, especially in rural communities anxious about economic competition from freedmen. Following the war, black farmers sought the same economic and political freedoms the poor whites of the early 19th c. had, many immigrating to Indiana. Segregation efforts were immediate, but nowhere near as severe as Jim Crow.\nAs for the Klan:\nThe KKK likes to cloak itself as a Christian organization, which attracted Indiana Baptist communities near the turn of the century with promises of Christian governance and an economic revival - playing heavily on fears of Catholics, immigrants, and POC. For all they offend, the KKK are, and have historically been, *masters* at selling themselves.

There was no uniform, steam-lined court system in medieval Europe, especially before the 12th century. The theoretical supremacy of royal court within individual kingdoms were first recognized in the 13th century, but even then, there were several non-royal courts like the aristocratic or town ones, sometimes even with overlapping jurisdictions.   \nAs for the trial record, it should be take in mind that many legal documents in medieval Europe in fact 'petitionary rather than prosecutional' (Arnold 2021: 57). It means that the court and its documentary record was often utilized only if at least either of the parties chose to resort to the court in order to reach an agreement with another party, of course with better terms. The well-known French proverb goes: 'The agreement is superior to the law, and the settlement is also superior to the judgement (*Pactum legem vincit et amor judicium*)'. So, not every legal cases, especially petty ones, were expected to be recorded from the beginning to the end in the parchments, and often we don't know which kind of end of story individual cases had. Anyway, sorry for digress.  \n+++\n&gt;Is it in the communal house?  \nYes. Many high and later medieval cities especially stored judicial records in form of books, usually in the communal archives. They have also been transmitted to us (if possible) and now often found in the town/ municipal archives, though the main content of these judicial records must have involved with property issues. Many of such documents in the archives have usually not been transcribed for publishing, so historians often have to try to read their handwritten scripts.  \nGenerally speaking, town/ municipal archives are and should be the hoard as well as the main workplace for medieval historians, especially specialized either in social, socio-economic or legal history especially in the Continent or Mediterranean region.    \nAs for the case of medieval England, [several medieval manorial records that also include the trial records roll of the landlord's judgement unto peasants (linked to the blog entry with the picture of an original manorial roll)](https://etseq.law.harvard.edu/2017/09/852-rare-an-introduction-to-our-english-manor-roll-collection/) are usually also now found in local archives.  \nThe following trial records of the peasants are taken from one of these manorial records (Bailey trans. 2002: 200):  \n&gt;* 'William Wauncy in mercy for cutting and taking away dry willow wood from Ladyswood, pardoned because poor'.  \n&gt;* 'John Man amerced 3d. because he milled his corn away from the lord's mill'.    \n+++\n&gt;Vatican storage?  \nAs I summarized before in [How much influence did the Pope have over distant European countries like Sweden and Scotland before the Protestant Reformation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jiwg8f/how_much_influence_did_the_pope_have_over_distant/), Vatican Secret Library certainly had a unique collection of the legal documents that recently attract much attention from researchers. They were the documents in response to petitions from different part of late medieval Europe, both of laypersons and of clergy, and mainly deal with their issues in the light of medieval Canon laws, the basic regulation of Catholic Church (Cf. Salonen &amp; Schmugge 2009).   \nIt is worth noting, however. that the main purpose of these papal documents were to give special dispensation in response to individual petitions, not to judge the cases mechanically in accordance with Canon Law. So, they were probably primarily not trial records OP is looking for.  \nOn contrary of possible general assumption, the majority of inquisition records are NOT necessarily found in the Vatican Archives, but one of the most famous ones, Jacques Fournier's inquisition register (1318-25) is certainly stored in Vatican as Vat, Lat.

He, in collaboration with many other legal and social scholars, started to articulate the framework in the late 1970s, anchored in the ongoing work of civil rights activists who were looking to focus on laws as a driver for change as they felt the movement was losing momentum. Informed by the thinking of Critical Legal Studies, Bell approached the law with the understanding that laws aren't objective and neutral. Instead, they reflect the bias, prejudices, perspectives, and goals of the human beings who passed the laws and who are responsible for enforcing them. \nIt's helpful in the modern era to think of CRT as a field of legal scholarship that crosses different aspects of the law and serves as a way for legal scholars to think about the law, which in turn, informs how politicians and activists who study the scholarship think about the law and their efforts to change the law. \nCRT, depending on which text one consults and when the text was written and who authored the piece, is generally recognized as having 5 to 7 tenets. (I'm familiar with CRT as it's used in education and around education law and am most familiar with the five as described by scholars such as Gloria Landson-Billings.) The five tenets can be summarized as^1:\n1. Acknowledging that racism is an invisible norm and white culture and Whiteness is the standard by which other races are measured.\n2. Committing to understanding that racism is socially constructed and\nexpanded and an inclusive worldview is required for true social justice.\n3. Acknowledging the unique perspective and voice of people of color as\nvictims of oppression in racial matters and valuing their story telling\nas a legitimate way to convey knowledge.\n4. Engaging in interdisciplinary dialogue and discourse to analyze race relationships.\n5. An understanding that racism is systemic, and that many current\npolicies and laws are: (1) neither ahistorical nor apolitical; and (2) are\nsituated to privilege white people and marginalize members of minoritized groups.\nThe construct, firmly linked to the mental model that the law is not objective, was informed by the work of leaders in the feminist movement including scholars such as Barbara Smith (a founder of the Combahee River Collective who created the concept of \"identity politics\" to describe how the group of Black women advocate for social change based in their identity as Black women. She was also an editor on foundational text, *All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave* which looks at how the law impacts women of color, especially Black women.) Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, also a legal scholar, would build upon Bell and Smith's work to develop the legal theory of \"intersectionality\" to describe the ways in which laws impact women of color, especially Black women. \nLegal scholars and civil rights activists from other communities contributed to scholarship including Indigenous and Native, Hispanic and Latinx, and Asian scholars who focused on how the law impacts people with disabilities, and others.  Mari J. Matsuda recently wrote about the origins of the theory in an essay called, [Critical Race Theory is not Anti-Asian](http://reappropriate.co/2021/03/mari-matsuda-critical-race-theory-is-not-anti-asian/) and laid out the early involvement of Asian American legal and social scholars in the work. \nFinally, while there is no \"opposite\" to CRT as that's not how theories work, it can be helpful to think of CRT as a response to the idea of meritocracy, which is a sociological or political theory that claims people can rise (as it were) in a society based on their skill and aptitude alone. \n______________\n1.*[Derrick Bell, CRT, and educational leadership 1995\u2013present](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2013.817770)*, Muhammad Khalifa, Christopher Dunbar &amp; Ty-Ron Douglasb (2013) Race Ethnicity and Education, 16:4, 489-513\n*[Critical Race Theory: An Annotated Bibliography](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1073418?seq=1)*, Delgado and Stefancic, Virginia Law Review\nVol. 79, No. 2 (Mar., 1993), pp. 461-516 (56 pages), Virginia Law Review"}}

Marx's correspondence has been available in English for a while now thanks to the *Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works* (abbreviated MECW), so in addition to his public writings on Lincoln we have his private thoughts too. But first, some background on Marx's opinion of Lincoln while he was alive.\nDuring the Antebellum, Marx's political contacts in America were mostly of a pro-Republican bent. Many veterans of the 1848 revolution in Germany fled to America, including Marx's friend Joseph Weydemeyer (who later became an officer in the Union army); Marx himself even considered emigrating to America. Many of these former revolutionaries took their democratic and largely anti-slavery politics with them. During the 1850s, Marx eked out a fairly meager living by writing for the pro-Republican New York Daily Tribune, which was founded by Horace Greeley a decade earlier. \nWith the outbreak of the secession crisis in late 1860 and early 1861, Marx and his friend Friedrich Engels began to pay close attention to the situation in America. Marx's (and Engels') opinion of Lincoln during this period followed from his conduct of the war \u2014 and, in particular, the question of slavery. Engels was skeptical of Lincoln's willingness to move against slavery, and hence was more pessimistic about Lincoln, at least early in the war; take, for instance, his letter to Marx in mid-1862:\n&gt; They shrink from conscription, from resolute fiscal measures, from attacking slavery, from everything that is urgently necessary; everything's left to amble along at will, and, if some factitious measure finally gets through Congress, the honourable Lincoln hedges it about with so many clauses that it's reduced to nothing at all. .... As I have already said, unless the North instantly adopts a revolutionary stance, it will get the terrible thrashing it deserves \u2014 and that's what seems to be happening.^1\nMarx, by contrast, was more confident that Lincoln would be forced into \"revolutionary methods,\"^2 and indeed was pleased by the Emancipation Proclamation and other measures in late 1862:\n&gt; The fury with which the Southerners are greeting Lincoln's acts is proof of the importance of these measures. Lincoln's acts all have the appearance of inflexible, clause-ridden conditions communicated by a lawyer to his opposite number. This does not, however, impair their historical import ...^3\nBoth men were, in private, critical of Lincoln's perceived timidity \u2014 Marx refers to his \"lawyer-fashion\"^4 \u2014 but by 1864 their opinion of Lincoln had improved sufficiently that Marx felt it appropriate to write his [famous address to Lincoln](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1864/lincoln-letter.htm) on behalf of the International Workingmen's Association congratulating Lincoln on his conduct in the fight against the Confederacy. \nThe first mention of Lincoln's assassination in Marx's correspondence comes on May 3rd, 1865, where Marx writes to Engels that\n&gt; The chivalry of the South has ended worthily. In addition, Lincoln's assassination was the most stupid act they could have committed. *Johnson* is stern, inflexible, and revengeful and as a former poor white has a deadly hatred of the oligarchy. He will make less fuss about these fellows, and because of the treachery, he will find the temper of the North commensurate with his intentions.^5\nSo, whereas Marx perceived Lincoln to be somewhat milquetoast, he initially perceived Johnson to be a more decisive figure. Publicly, Marx signed the [address of the International to President Johnson](https://www.marxists.org/history/international/iwma/documents/1865/johnson-letter.htm), proclaiming Lincoln a martyr to the cause of anti-slavery and urging Johnson to take up where he left off.\nBy June 1865, however, Marx's opinion on Johnson had soured as he realized Johnson was not really going to punish the old Southern enslaver elite:\n&gt; Johnson's policy likes me not. A ludicrous affectation of severity towards individuals; hitherto excessively vacillating and weak when it comes down to it. The reaction has already set in in America and will soon be much fortified if the present lackadaisical attitude is not ended immediately.^6\nBy the next year Marx was openly celebrating Johnson's defeat:\n&gt; You will have been just as delighted by the defeat of President Johnson in the latest elections as I was. The workers in the North have at last fully understood that white labour will never be emancipated so long as black labour is still stigmatised.^7\nSo, while Marx was initially excited about the prospects of Lincoln's \"stern\" successor, his hopes were quickly dashed.\n1.

{"question": "Why did Late Medieval paintings of the Crucifixion frequently depict a dog and a skull at the base of the Cross?\nI recently visited the Belvedere Museum in Vienna and noticed that several of the paintings of the Crucifixion depicted a dog and skull at the base of the cross, usually on opposite sides of it. I realize the paintings I've included in the links below are limited to Salzburg/Austria in the 15th century but they are also by different artists from different decades of that century. I've tried looking for an answer elsewhere online and haven't found much beyond the obvious generalities that skulls represent death and dogs represent loyalty. I would've found this a satisfying enough answer if the dog was clearly placed at the feet of somebody like Mary but that isn't the case here except potentially in the example below that has two dogs and places the one at Mary(?)'s feet playing with a child next to a skull while on the opposite side of the cross there is another dog that is alone. Another of the pictures I've posted below has a dog and skull at the base of the cross but the dog is actually chewing on a bone in this example.  \nMy best guess following the general symbolism of skulls meaning death and dogs meaning loyalty is that Jesus was only executed (death) because of Judas's lack of loyalty which is why the dog (loyalty) is placed on the opposite side of the cross from the skull. Other paintings done by the same artists for the examples below clearly depicted the scene of Judas's betrayal at Gethsemane (in interestingly different ways, e.g. in one example he is the only character in the painting with red hair but that is a separate question) which indicates to me that the topic of the betrayal of the Christ was a popular topic at this time/in this area. Still, I'm perplexed by the possible symbolism of the example of the dog that is chewing on a human bone and not on the opposite side of the cross since the skull is placed at the base of it in this example (which is actually the earliest of the examples I provided though by an unknown artist).   \nSaid pictures:  \n[https://imgurupload.org/files/WeChat-Image-20210905231747.jpg](https://imgurupload.org/files/WeChat-Image-20210905231747.jpg)  \n[https://imgurupload.org/files/WeChat-Image-20210905231813.jpg](https://imgurupload.org/files/WeChat-Image-20210905231813.jpg)  \n[https://imgurupload.org/files/WeChat-Image-20210905231821.jpg](https://imgurupload.org/files/WeChat-Image-20210905231821.jpg)  \nThanks for any insight you may have and I apologize for my phone photography skills.", "prompt_source": "AskHistorian", "details": {"submission_date": "2021-09-05 17:49:53", "submission_ID": "pim53g", "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pim53g/why_did_late_medieval_paintings_of_the/", "comment_ID": "hbtqsf3", "upvote": 47, "comment_date": "2021-09-06 12:42:55", "auto_references": "\nMarrow, James. 1977. \u201cCircumdederunt Me Canes Multi: Christ\u2019s Tormentors in Northern European Art of the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance.\u201d The Art Bulletin 59 (2): 167\u201381. https://doi.org/10.2307/3049628.\nPastoureau, Michel. 2011.

Medieval bestiaries, which recorded the good and bad qualities of real and imaginary animals, described dogs as filthy, impure, gross, ungrateful, likely to get rabies. And dogs were lewd, always sniffing each other's butts and always fornicating, including with females of other species like wolves or tigers (!). But they were also given the same qualities that we consider today typical of dogs: courage, intelligence, memory, sense of smell, and above all loyalty. The symbolic standing of dogs actually got better by the end of the Middle Ages (Pastoureau, 2011).\nHowever, there was that problematic stuff in the Bible, in Psalm 22 (the one that starts with \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" in the KJB). Psalm 22 is about a person being tormented by their enemies:\n&gt; For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.\n&gt; I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.\n&gt; They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.\n&gt; But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.\n&gt; Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.\nWhile Psalm 22 is not about Jesus, it is referenced in the New Testament during the Crucifixion (not the dogs though), and, due to its prophetic aspect, it was used by writers and artists in the Middle Ages as the main source to characterize the Christ's tormentors. Those works made use of the nasty animals featured in the Psaum, notably the lion (another ambivalent creature at the time) and the dog. Art historian James Marrow (1977) has written an article about the presence of dogs in medieval representations of the Passion (literary and iconographic). After describing dogs in Passion texts (notably tracts), he says:\n&gt; This lenghty source of citations representing only a sample from our sources, should serve to indicate how ubiquitous was the \"tormentors as dogs\" metaphor - now actually a simile - in late medieval Passion literature. Thus it is no surprise to find the conceit expressed as ubiquitously in contemporary art. A survey of art of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries will turn up a considerable number of seemingly innocent depictions of dogs. The presence of dogs in secular as well as in religious art implies that the motive is frequently without iconographic significance, but the more one looks at the representation of dogs in scenes from Christ's Passion, the more one finds indications that the dogs express the simile and are not merely staffage [human and animal characters \"extras\" in paintings]. Depictions of dogs that are meant to characterize or identify Christ's tormentors range from the subtle to the pointedly obvious.\nThe presence of children in Passion paintings, which was also common, has less direct explanations. Writing about this topic, Ziolkowski (2001) actually mentions [one of the paintings](https://imgurupload.org/files/WeChat-Image-20210905231813.jpg) you saw in Vienna (by Conrad Laib) and notes the frequent combinations of children and dogs, often cavorting together. For Ziolkowski, the association of boys and dogs drew the former in the group of tormentors, which already included dogs. In any case, the omnipresence of not-so-innocent children in Passion paintings \"impl[ied] that the child could not be divorced from the notion of the general sinfulness of humanity\".\nAbout the redhead Judas: indeed, Judas started being represented with red hair in the second half of the 9th century in the Meuse and Rhine region, and this new attribute spread to the rest of Europe. In the 13th century, Judas having red hair (and a red beard) was part of his standard attributes. He was not alone. Drawing from earlier traditions, having red hair was an attribute given to numerous \"evil\" figures (Cain, Ganelon, Mordred...), and to many groups of despised people, including prostitutes, jugglers, executioners or butchers. Pastoureau (2015) mentions that another attribute of Judas was having a dog at his side, but I've not been able to find an example (Pastoureau, 2015).\n**Sources**\n* Marrow, James. \u201cCircumdederunt Me Canes Multi: Christ\u2019s Tormentors in Northern European Art of the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance.\u201d The Art Bulletin 59, no. 2 (1977): 167\u201381. https://doi.org/10.2307/3049628.\n* Pastoureau, Michel.

{"question": "Why did the native empires of the Inca , Maya,and Aztecs fall so much faster than the native tribes in the north who seemed to adapt , fight conquering forces ,and lasted longer independent ?\nThe empires ofSouth and Meso America were much larger and seemingly more centralized and militarily advanced than those in the north. Obviously I understand that the Inca had just undergone a brutal civil war making them even more susceptible to conquest and the Aztecs had many hated vassal and tributary groups that joined the conquistadors. And lastly disease was a huge aspect to the fall of both groups to Europeans/ Americans. Though one could say the conflict between the British and French and later Americans and British kept them expansion low, the Portuguese  were in near the Spanish with Brazil. The terrain of North America would seem less hostile and difficult than meso america and definitely the peaks of the Incan empire. Did the more centralized and more technologically development of the empires make them weaker. The Incan roads made travel in the empire easy for them but it made it far easier for the Conquistadors to move horses, troops, cannon and ammunition than it would\u2019ve been without it. South and Central America seem larger than Latin America though north and south than east and west. And though both groups died of diseases like small pox, the conquest of the north took hundreds of more years, the native groups existed as independent nations such as the Iroquois confederacy, Tecumseh\u2019s confederacy,and waged war such as by the Seminoles and runaway slaves,  king Philips war,  and battles such as little big horn and the massacre of wounded knee. Many native groups adapted European arms and in the case of horses even more so than the Europeans/ Americans .

I'll mainly focus on your central question (why did indigenous empires in Central and South America fall more quickly than indigenous peoples in northern North America), but I'll also talk a little bit about the many indigenous South Americans who *weren't* part of empires or what we would call centralized states.\n**Short answer:** \nPolitical centralization facilitated European efforts to conquer entire indigenous states in many cases. However, important sections of your question are based on pretty false historical tropes (which I don't really blame you for; there are countless ways that indigenous histories in the Americas have been twisted and overwritten. European conquests of the Inca and Maya were slower and less complete than I think your question implies, and many indigenous peoples of Central and South America *did* fight colonization for centuries after contact, and even up into the modern day.\n**Long answer:**\nThe political centralization of conquered states was a *really* important deal, especially in the first steps of European colonization efforts. When Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro respectively captured Moctezuma and especially Atawallpa, they took significant control over formal governments that had large and established relations with millions of people across huge tracts of land. With victories in specific locations, Europeans were then able to lay claim to entire, previously legitimized states and their extensive borders. \nBut there's more to the importance of political centralization than just \"they were easier to conquer because you only had to defeat one group to control a huge area.\" Empires like the Inca and Aztec couldn't have functioned without governmental bureaucracy, record keeping, and formal systems of control. Spanish colonial efforts often focused on rerouting those systems to Spanish goals. For example, the Spanish took the long-established Inca *mit'a* public labor system, and continued it in a (more predatory) way.^(1) This meant that Spanish goals could thrive off a previously established centralizing and taxation-like economic system, without the Spanish needing to build those massive systems themselves. Spanish efforts were also better able to transfer the political legitimacy of more centralized states onto themselves.  Both Inca and Aztec noble women were married into Spanish families, which gave the Spanish genealogical legitimacy to power. ^(3)  Spanish efforts were also able to draw on the legitimacy of noble records, documents, and discussions in order to enforce their power. And indigenous peoples in empires were quickly able to familiarize themselves with colonial bureaucracy in ways that encouraged them to use the Spanish crown as a means to maintain their own economic and social positions.^(4)\nEven centralized states like the Tarascan Empire, which was joined into the Spanish empire through more mutually peaceful means than the Aztecs or Inca, went through similar colonial processes. In short, centralized states meant that less conquering meant more rewards. But more than that, I would argue that the Spanish were able to hijack political, bureaucratic, and other institutionally legitimizing aspects of centralized power. \nThis plays directly into a discussion of Spanish relations with Maya states. Unlike the Inca, Aztec, Tarascans, and other empires that the Spanish conquered, the Maya *were not* a unified and centralized empire. Instead, the Maya were divided into multiple kingdoms. Perhaps these various governments and the need to conquer them individually played a role in the fact that the last independent Maya kingdom was only conquered in 1697 - almost 180 years after the first Spanish incursions on Maya sovereignties. \nAnd that leads into a discussion of how many Central and South American indigenous peoples actually did resist the Spanish for much longer than is commonly recognized, and were often extremely successful in doing so. The length of Maya resistance to the Spanish should not only be attributed to their status as a group of multiple kingdoms; the Maya fought hard and convincingly, often successfully repulsing Spanish efforts. And even after Nojpeten - the last independent kingdom - fell in 1697, many Maya were still largely autonomous, posing significant and often violent threats to Spanish/Mexican rule through the mid-19th century Caste War and up into modern times with organizations such as the EZLN (Zapatistas). \nMaya resistance and continued autonomy wasn't the only case. Although most narratives stop the Inca Empire's history in 1533, the [Neo-Inca State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Inca_State#/media/File:Per%C3%BA_%C2%B7_Cusco.png) existed under Sapa Inca rule until 1572, and Inca-associated rebellions continued through the 18th century at least. Colonial *claims* should not necessarily be taken as realities of colonial control.\nIn southern South America, the Mapuche successfully defeated the Spanish and fought Chile and Argentina until the 1870s, and indigenous resistance in the area has continued long after that. Just north of Mexico City, the 16th century Chichimeca war against the Spanish ended in Chichimeca military victory. Various Amazonian peoples resisted colonial efforts through the modern period and have remained largely politically autonomous. Wherever you look across Central and South America, you can find histories of indigenous people resisting and successfully fighting against colonial (and neocolonial) powers for just as long - if not longer - than in Canada and the United States.\n&amp;#x200B;\n^(1) Montero, R.

I also wanted to follow up with some additional information as to why Patton probably \"believed the canard that the crimes of Nazi Germany were limited to the bigwig elites in power\", and that is due to his acquaintance with Alois Podhajsky, the director of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Austria. Podhajsky had also competed in dressage at the 1936 Summer Olympics, also known as the \"Nazi Olympics\", with which Patton was familiar.\nAmong more equestrian-inclined historians like myself, Patton is popularly credited for saving the Lipizzaner horse breed from extinction during WWII. For many of his massive moral failings, Patton's actions to relocate the horses - which were under German control at the time - is widely credited as having saved the breed as a \"jewel\" of equestrian history and heritage. I feel it is unlikely that Patton would have saved the Lipizzaners if he did not hold the Germans - and particularly, Podhajsky - in as high esteem as he did, which played a key role in the Lipizzaners' evacuation.\nSpecifically, the Lipizzaner is a 400-year-old military breed of horse developed for the horse Cavalry by the Hapsburgs within the Hapsburg Empire (Spain and Austria). After the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian empire after WWI, and the invasion and annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany (\"The Anschluss\") on 12 March 1938, the high command of Nazi Germany transferred most of Europe's Lipizzaner breeding stock to a Nazi-run farm in Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The Nazi German command removed Lippizzaners from the stud at Pieber, Austria, in 1942, and transferred all other known populations of Lippizzaners from across Europe to consolidate them in Hostau in 1943. \nDuring WWII, the Lipizzaners were evacuated  to St. Martins, Austria, from Vienna in January 1945 due to Allied bombing of Vienna. Colonel Alois Podhajsky feared for the horses' lives, and reached out to U.S. General George S. Patton for help. Patton and Podhajsky had previously competed in equestrian events at the Olympic Games against one another, and were acquaintances. Due to Patton advocating on Podhajsky's behalf, the U.S Army agreed to evacuate the Lipizzaners to behind Allied lines.\nWithout Patton's previous acquaintance with Podhajsky, there would have been a much more likely chance of the U.S. Army denying Podhajsky's request; and, thus, the likely loss of the Lipizzaner breed as a whole to the advancing Soviets. Patton believed Podhajsky's claim that \"the Soviets would slaughter and eat the Lipizzaner horses\", but a more in-depth investigation that I did indicated this may have been an exaggeration, as the USSR's Semyon Budyonny - the founder of the Budyonny breed of horse - had previously incorporated captured German horses (i.e. Trakheners) into the USSR's Cavalry.\nSources:\n- *The Perfect Horse: The Daring U.S. Mission to Rescue the Priceless Stallions Kidnapped by the Nazis* by Elizabeth Letts (ISBN: 034554482X)\n- *Ghost Riders: Operation Cowboy, the World War Two Mission to Save the World's Finest Horses* by Mark Felton (ISBN-10: 1785785095)"}}

This was a Cold War project that would allow for decentralised communication, data storage and \"super computer\" capabilities which was understood at the time to mean multiple computers running tasks in parallel as part of a single program. It was a large network of computers that crossed the United States, including Hawaii. [Wikipedia has a great image showing the network's status in 1974](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Arpanet_1974.svg). While the scale and scope of ARPANET was a secret, its theoretical underpinning was not. Public research papers like D.W. Davies' \"Proposal for a Digital Communication Network\" defined both the concepts and the language we'd use to discuss them. \"Proposal for a Digital Communication Network\" for example defined and labeled the \"packet\". And so even though people may not have know that such a large network really existed at their time, the knowledge that it could and exactly how it would work were public knowledge.\nBy late 1967 the basic ideas of what a computer network should be and what it should do were in place. It should support:\n1. One mainframe sending a program to another in an effort at load balancing.\n2. E-Mail\n3. Data sharing\n4. Program sharing\n5. Remote login\nHowever, you might notice that this doesn't quite line up with how R2 uses the Imperial computers and is at odds with the whole premise of the movie's opening act. If we could transfer data over the network, why move the data by disk and risk it not getting there?\nThat's because much of the feel for computers in Star Wars comes from terminal + mainframe systems. These were large computers which were shared between a large number of different users. Users could access the mainframe either via a terminal which was hardwired or via a local phone line. Before networking, moving data between mainframes could only be done via tape. \nOne other part of your question I just want to touch on quickly is the idea of an \"interconnected vast computer network\". That implies multiple networks interconnected, as we have today. The basic networking stuff was worked out on a theoretical level in the 1950s and 1960s, and therefore can be assumed to have been knowledge available to the writers or technical consultants on Star Wars. However, \"internetworking\" (as it was called) was extremely cutting edge science at the time they were making Star Wars and while the first internetwork connection from the ARPANET was in 1972, I don't think it was common public knowledge. Therefore I'd imagine that the Imperial network was, in the minds of the writers, a single network instead of a network of networks. Of course it's also possible that the writers wouldn't have know about this distinction at all, but the historical point still stands that the development of networking and internetworking wasn't a single field until the late 1970s. \nAll told, the historical background for how computers work in Star Wars is one part computer networking as we think of it and one part terminal/mainframe systems. R2 himself is both a microcomputer (that is a computer small enough to move between rooms) and a terminal. The networking we see in Star Wars reflects some of the concepts we see in science journals from the time and therefore includes terminals, microcomputers, mainframe computers and computer networks but lacks explicit mention of more cutting edge ideas such as internetworking. \nSources:\n* Lucas, G et al. \"Star Wars\" (1977)\n* Davies, D.W. \"Proposal for a Digital Communication Network\" (1966)\n* Kleinrock, L \"An early history of the internet\" (2010)\n* Hauben, M \"History of ARPANET\" (2007)\n* Roberts, L \"The ARPANET and Computer Networks\" (1988)"}}
{"question": "During Japan's time as a \"tributary state\" of the Ming, how was the Japanese sovereign styled in Chinese texts, compared to Japanese texts of the same era?\nToday the Emperor of Japan is referred to in Chinese as the \"Tian Huang\", meaning roughly \"Heavenly Emperor\", which is just a Sinitic reading of the Sino-Japanese Tennou (the \"ou\" \u7687 used here is not to be confused with the \"ou\" \u738b meaning \"king\", which corresponds to Chinese \"wang\").\nAlthough I can't claim to know, I would assume the Ming dynasty did not really acknowledge the existence of any foreign _Huang_ \u7687 or _Di_ \u5e1d.

That doesn't mean I didn't find anything, and indeed I can go a bit further back. Obviously as this is sort of a list of titles, it will be a bit episodic.\nThe *Annals of Later Han* reference the provision of a seal to an embassy from the state of *Wo* in 57 CE, which was apparently recovered by accident in the eighteenth century by a Japanese farmer. Legendarily, the Japanese emperors were already reigning by this point, but the seal itself reads *han wei na guo wang* \u6f22\u59d4\u5974\u570b\u738b \u2013 while its interpretation is not entirely certain, it seems to suggest a) that *weina* was a term for the main Japanese polity by this stage, and that the ruler was titled *guowang* ('king') as far as the Chinese were concerned. The use of a variation on *wang* as the title for the Japanese monarch repeated during the next major contact, when the ruler Himiko sent a delegation to the post-Han state of Wei in 239 that led to her being recognised as *qin wei wowang* \u89aa\u9b4f\u502d\u738b ('Friendly to Wei, Ruler of *Wo*').\nThe next major milestone seems to have been in 607, when Empress Suiko's embassy to Sui Yangdi brought a letter which referred to both rulers as *Tianzi* \u5929\u5b50 (Child of Heaven), one in the land of the rising sun and one in the land of the setting sun. This led to a refusal to address the embassy, though contacts continued in an attempt to clear up the *faux pas*. Amidst the back-and-forth of 607-608 a new phrase had been coined, *ri ben zhu ming le mei yu de* \u65e5\u672c\u4e3b\u660e\u6a02\u7f8e\u5fa1\u5fb7, the last six characters of which are a transliteration of the variant imperial title of *sumeramikoto* (also written \u5929\u7687). On the Japanese side, this preserved the imperial title for their own emperor and elevated him above a mere *guowang*, while the Sui, and late the Tang, could still interpret the title as placing the Japanese ruler in the inferior position. There also seems to have been a variant form of that beginning with *xu* instead of *zhu* but I haven't yet found the character for it.\nWhat complicates things, though, is the use, real or proposed, of *ri ben guo wang* \u65e5\u672c\u570b\u738b ('*guowang* of Japan') to designate the *de facto* head of government at various times. Taira no Kiyomori, *daij\u014d-daijin* under Emperor Takakura, was referred to as such by an embassy from the Southern Song in 1172; during the peace negotiations of the lull in the Great East Asian War (or Imjin War), the Ming's final terms to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1595 also included his recognition as *ri ben guo wang* \u2013 prompting him to angrily assert that he *was* the king of Japan for all intents and purposes, whether the Ming recognised it or not! And of course in between, the Ashikaga *sh\u014dguns* had also been referred to by that title. As the principal recipient of any correspondence would be the functional ruler rather than the ceremonial, it seems as though the title *ri ben guo wang* remained standard, and applied to emperors or *sh\u014dguns* depending on who was actually in charge.\nThis changed in 1635, when Tokugawa Iemitsu first began to accept the title of *[ri ben guo] da jun*/*[nihon-koku] taikun* [\u65e5\u672c\u570b]\u5927\u541b. This came after the alternatives, both *wang* and *jiangjun*/*sh\u014dgun*, had been rejected by Iemitsu's predecessors, on the basis that *wang* both implied subordination to China and eroded the status of the Japanese emperor, while *sh\u014dgun* did not really translate well (as its Chinese reading, *jiangjun*, simply means 'general'). *Taikun* ('Great Prince', from which English loaned the word 'tycoon') got around it by being a distinct title of majesty that did not challenge the status of the emperor within Japan, while also not having precedents that implied subordination to China.\nI've had less luck finding any specific information as to how the Qing viewed the 'restored' Emperor Meiji after 1868, but it seems from the 1871 and 1885 Qing-Japanese treaties that the Japanese imperial claim was at least tacitly recognised, as the treaties include both the Qing and Japanese reign dates. While some in China asserted that Meiji's title was illegitimate, particularly in the wake of military defeats to Japan in late 1894, the ultimate Treaty of Shimonoseki gave the two rulers equal titles and honorifics: *da qing di guo da huang bi xia* \u5927\u6e05\u5e1d\u570b\u5927\u7687\u965b\u4e0b and *da ri ben di guo da huang bi xia* \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b\u5927\u7687\u5e1d\u965b\u4e0b ('Great Qing/Japanese Empire | Great Emperor | His Majesty'), settling the question once and for all. Well, at least until the Qing were overthrown and the Republic of China installed in their place.\n### Sources\n* Joshua A.

The camps were set up and organized by the RSHA (*Reichssicherheitshauptamt = Reich Security Main Office)* which was directed by Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, Gestapo and Minister of Internal Affairs (Head of Police) after '35. The SS ran the camps, and as such the SS was not part of the army. So, German regular soldiers (of those drafted into the regular army, the *Wehrmacht)*, did generally not serve in the camps for this pure logistical reason -- it was not the army's prerogative.  \nThe SS was an all-volunteer organizations until the last stages of the war ('44 or so), when it did began drafting as well. Having said that, it remains one of the shocking aspects of the Holocaust that when Nazi Germany began in '33, the SS counted about 50,000 men, and at the end of the war it counted 1,200,000. Of that latter number, by the spring of '45, more than 600,000 were from countries other than Germany, and most of them volunteers (eg 80k from France and Belgium each, 40k from the Netherlands, 20k from Sweden, 20k from Lithuania etc etc). \nThe SS had military units fighting in the field alongside the regular army (these were the so-called *Waffen-SS*) but again, these were not the ones running the camps (but did commit some of the worst atrocities outside of them). \nSo, of the SS serving in the camps (the so-called *Totenkopf-SS*, the \"Skulls\"-SS), the majority was German, but there were often local units and auxiliary police involved. Of the non-Germans serving in the camp, some countries were statistically \"overrepresented\" (e.g. Austria -- ca 20% of the Auschwitz SS guards were from Austria, which is less than 1/10th the size of Germany by population). So the picture is a little more complicated than that. The overall death apparatus of the Holocaust (camps, guards, execution squads, train logistics etc) roughly required about a million people actively participating, out of which approximately half was German.  \nSS men after the war would sometimes say they made a choice to be Waffen-SS rather than Totenkopf for moral reasons, but the truth is that within the Nazi apparatus the Waffen-SS was considered of \"higher value\" or more \"heroic\" than the lowly camp guards, whose careers usually did not reach much beyond, whereas Waffen-SS officers could rise to the status of a General equivalent.

How exactly George Washington himself knew about Tibet, that I specifically can't answer. What I can say is that by the 18th century, Tibetan Buddhism wasn't exactly completely unknown to Europe.\nIn the beginning of the 17th century the western Mongolian Oirats began a steady migration to the lower Volga region, coming in contact with the Imperial Russian state. They would come to be known as the Kalmyks, and formed a Khanate from 1630\u20131771, when Catherine the Great incorporated the Kalmyk holdings into the Russian empire. The Kalmyks moved westwards towards Russia for a variety of reasons, confined territories amongst rising feudal competition, sparse population density in the west Urals and Volga region, favorable trading opportunities with the Russians, and some diplomatic buffers to offset Nogai and Crimean Tatar power proved incentivizing for the Russians. With time, the Kalmyks swore oaths of fealty and arranged treaties with the Russians, this was not a mere conquest by the Russian Empire, but a gradual process of voluntary incorporation. Kalmyks contributed to Russian military endeavors in the 18th century onwards, such as the Northern War and Russo-Turkish Wars (eventually too some Kalmyks even joined the Coalition Powers against Napoleon.) Whatever the case, the Kalmyks, through the Russian Empire, became a greater part of the international stage with its proximity towards Europe. Indeed, Russia had long contact with Mongolian powers historically, but the Kalmyks proved a closer and more concrete relationship. Moreover having read some of Catherine's memoirs I recall she mentions a number of Kalmyk servants and maids for the aristocracy.\nThe relevance of the Kalmyks and Mongolian powers in this time is their close adherence to Tibetan Buddhism. Mongolians had began adopting Tibetan esoteric and tantric Buddhism during the 13th century, as the religion offered political and religious legitimization for the Khans, as well as power balances against established systems such as in China. Oirats in particular followed the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, a major branch which the Dalai Lama is the spiritual head. Under the Khoshut Khanate Tibet was unified under the authority of the 5th Dalai Lama. A later Oirat power, the Dzungars, toppled the Khoshuts but continued political relations with the Dalai Lama. The Kalmyks were no exception, one of their greatest leaders Ayuka Khan had been confirmed his title by the Dalai Lama, and it was Ayuka Khan that Peter the Great had personally met to enlist Kalmyk support against the Persians.\nThere's much more than can be said about the Kalmyks, Oirats, and Tibetans, but the important thing here is that as devoted Buddhists, the Kalmyks and other Mongolian groups in the Russian Empire offered early European contact with Tibetan Buddhism. Given the obvious importance of the United States forming diplomat relations with international powers such as the Russians, it's not unlikely for Tibetan Buddhism to be mentioned.\n---\nAlso, not to fault the first President's lack of knowledge on Tibetan affairs, but it's somewhat inaccurate to think of \"eastern Lamas\" as shut off from society. Certainly many monastics were secluded in remote areas, but as with most Buddhist societies, temples formed a deeply close relationship with the lay community. Lamas were a part of everyday life, they offered spiritual guidance and religious duties, in exchange for the monetary and material support of the community they serviced.\nThe Dalai Lamas themselves were rather important political leaders.

It was known as *coucher \u00e0 la corde*, or *dormir \u00e0 la corde*.\nAn anonymous writer in *Le Charivari* wrote in 1842:\n&gt; There is somewhere, under the pillars of Les Halles [then the district of the Paris food market], in the neighborhood of Paul Niquet, a place where one sleeps at night on the floor for 7 centimes and a half per head. In this hovel there is a rope stretched out at support height and on which the mylords and aristocrats of the area have the privilege of leaning for the additional payment of five centimes. This is called *coucher \u00e0 la corde* [sleeping on the rope].\nPaul Niquet was an (in)famous cabaret owner in Les Halles, known for selling strong liquor. \nIn 1852, the chief editor of the same journal, Taxile Delord, a left-wing journalist, used the expression *coucher \u00e0 la corde* in a short funny piece about the trouble he had finding a place to sleep in Paris due to the Carnival. After trying to rent a room in several hotels, he ends up in a \"quite dark an filthy street\":\n&gt; \"Impossible, my good man,\" replied a voice behind the counter, \"so many Limousins have come to Paris for the Carnival that I have no more rope.\" I saw that I could not even find a place to sleep on the rope, so I decided to wait until dawn in my carriage. \nThe following year, Delord wrote an article titled \"Down to the rope\" full of outrage about projected street demolitions in Paris and the resulting homelessness of poor people:\n&gt; Last night at midnight, as I passed through the Place du Carrousel, I saw a man planting two stakes in the ground to which a long rope was attached. No sooner had this rope been stretched than a crowd of people approached it eagerly. These unfortunate people were homeless tenants who had come to sleep on the rope in the Place du Carrousel. There are dormitories of the same kind in a great many districts of the capital. They fight for places with a fierceness that often leads to brawls and duels. On nights when it rains, the sleepers hold their umbrellas open over their heads. This is what we have come to.\nWhile Delord's text is presented as a direct account, his article includes several jokes (he talks about a man whose house was demolished when he was vacationing!) and it is impossible to know whether he actually saw people \"on the rope\" or just made it up to sell his outrage.\nIn 1857, writer Charles Aubin wrote the following about the life of Parisian ragpickers (chiffonniers):\n&gt; From three to five in the morning, the ragpickers meet in certain cabarets in the Halles district, for example at the famous Paul Niquet's; there each of them receives for two *sous* a small glass of brandy and the right to sleep for two hours on the rope, [...] In front of the counter where the brandy is served, the cabaret-keeper stretches out a long rope, on which the ragpickers lean to sleep. At dawn, they must wake up and leave; to save the trouble of waking each ragpicker one by one, the barman unties the rope by one of its ends; all the sleepers fall on top of each other; they are awakened, they pick up their belongings and return to the filthy houses where they pile up the day's harvest.\nOne should note that Paul Niquet's establishment was demolished in 1853 (Huart, 1853), so Aubin's text was already outdated.\nThe expressions *coucher \u00e0 la corde* and *dormir \u00e0 la corde* seem to have entered the French language in the 1860s. It was mentioned in Pierre Larousse's Dictionnaire Universel in 1869 as follows:\n&gt; *Coucher \u00e0 la corde*, *dormir \u00e0 la corde*: To spend the night in one of these lodgings that they existed a few years ago in the outer districts and in the vicinity of the Halles, seated with one's arms supported on a rope stretched waist-high, that is untied early in the morning in order to awaken the sleepers. \nBy then, the practice seems to have acquired a legendary status. It shows up in numerous newspaper articles and novels until the 1930s, and it is often presented as something of the past, as in the novel of L\u00e9o Lesp\u00e8s *Les secrets de Paris* (Lesp\u00e8s, 1874):\n&gt; This way of being housed was called *coucher \u00e0 la corde*. It was misery, not crime, that lodged in this way.\nLesp\u00e8s' novelistic description includes some details not found elsewhere, notably that the sleepers were separated by knots on the rope, something that he may have made up. Others claimed that the practice still existed but that it was on its way out. An article on the \"lugubrious Paris\" mentions that the hotels *\u00e0 la corde* were disappearing in the late 1870s (M\u00e9rican, 1879). According to journalist Paul Bluysen, the hotels *\u00e0 la corde* had been put out of business by the opening of municipal shelters in 1886. In 1890, he wrote that there was only one *h\u00f4tel \u00e0 la corde* remaining in Paris, in the Goutte d'Or district (18th arrondissement). Charles Virma\u00eetre, in his slang dictionary of 1894, also claimed that municipal shelters ended the practice, and describes a *h\u00f4tel \u00e0 la corde* of the 11th arrondissement as follows:\n&gt; Before the invention of the municipal shelters, there was a hostel in the rue des Trois-Bornes, run by Father Jean. The only room was about twenty metres long and three metres wide. A thick rope was stretched along the whole length, finished with two strong rings which fixed it at each end. The customers, most of them *giverneurs*, paid three sous for the entrance; this sum gave them the right to sit with their arms on the rope and to sleep. About fifty people could fit in. At five o'clock in the morning Father John rang the alarm bell by tapping an old saucepan with a piece of iron. Among the sleepers there were some whose sleep was hard and who did not get up. Then Father John would unhook the rope and the sleepers would fall onto the flagstones. Sleeping on a rope is legendary (popular slang).\nIn the 1890s, another establishment, the H\u00f4tel Fradin, near the Halles, was often reported to use a rope. However, a journalist who visited the hotel found no such thing, and while it was a miserable place, people slept on benches and on beams, not on ropes (Blosseville, 1895). When Fradin died in 1902, newspapers mentioned the rope again, though the claim was that the rope was used as a \"pillow\" (Le XIXe Si\u00e8cle, 1902). In the 1920s, the Fradin hotel was still known for its rope, as [shown by this drawing](https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-journal-illustre/29-avril-1923/83/1077223/2) published in *Le Petit Journal* in 1923 (Chabannes, 1923). In 1930 the left-wing journal *L'Ami du Peuple* wrote that the \"inn of the Grappe d'Or and hovels near place Maubert were places where bums could sleep on the rope for 1.5 francs\", but the author may have used the expression in the general sense of \"sleeping rough\" (L\u00e9d\u00e9, 1930).\nSo, what to make of this? Like in the UK/US situation, it is difficult to separate facts from fiction. The numerous mentions of *h\u00f4tels \u00e0 la corde* in Paris, notably by left-wing writers (Delord, Bluysen) since the 1840s seem to indicate that the practice was real, though uncommon, and that it may have survived until the early 1920s, in some form or another. In any case, the name of the practice seems to have acquired over the years the general meaning of \"sleeping rough\". But it was also described as legendary (the Niquet place in the 1840-50s, the Fradin hotel since the 1890s), and it became something of a vivid literary trope (poor people sleeping on ropes, with the cruel hotelier waking them up at 5 or 6 am by untying the rope) useful to describe the sordid past - and occasionally the sordid present - of Paris.\n**Sources**\n* \u201cCauseries.\u201d Le Charivari, October 28, 1842. https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3055988z.\n* Aubin, Charles. \u201cLes mille et un m\u00e9tiers\u00a0: les chiffoniers.\u201d La Semaine des enfants\u00a0: magasin d\u2019images et de lectures amusantes et instructives, 1857. https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k424402c.\n* \u201cEchos.\u201d Le XIXe si\u00e8cle, May 21, 1902. https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-xixe-siecle/21-mai-1902/29/1914433/3.\n* Blosseville, Auguste. \u201cUne visite chez Fradin.\u201d La Patrie, May 9, 1895. https://www.retronews.fr/journal/la-patrie-1841-1937/9-mai-1895/2935/4566015/1.\n* Bluysen, Paul. \u201cCroquis parisiens.\u201d La R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise, January 10, 1890. https://www.retronews.fr/journal/la-republique-francaise-1871-1924/10-janvier-1890/655/1906577/2.\n* Chabannes, Jacques. \u201cA l\u2019asile de nuit.\u201d Le Petit Journal, April 29, 1923. https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-journal-illustre/29-avril-1923/83/1077223/2.\n* Delord, Taxile. \u201cJusqu\u2019\u00e0 la corde.\u201d RetroNews - Le site de presse de la BnF.

Any remaining Loyalists who didn't submit to US control after Yorktown would have faced serious hostility or actual violence from their neighbors and the government. \nDuring the Revolutionary war, Loyalists in majority-Patriot areas were subject to a spectrum of hostility ranging from social shunning and boycotts of their businesses to vandalism, confiscation of their property, and even escalating to beatings, death threats, and executions. Unlike the French revolution a few years later, there were not mass-killings of Loyalists, but a significant number were hanged either by lynch mobs or as part of a formal judicial process during the war. \nAfter the British surrender at Yorktown, many Loyalists left the US via New York (which was still in British hands at the end of the war). It's well known that many of these people went to Canada, Britain, or other British colonies. Many more stayed behind and accepted US independence. \nAfter independence, Loyalists faced continuing prejudice for their war-time loyalties. They were subject to inter-personal resentments and social consequences as well as legal restrictions. Penalties were more severe for those who had taken a military role, as compared to milder consequences for those who had provided only economic support or merely voiced their support of the Crown. Some Loyalists were prevented by law from returning to their home communities on pain of imprisonment until the 1790s, and restrictions preventing Loyalists from holding government office were maintained in some places for years afterward. \nThe end of the war did not mean an end to resentment or threats of violence, as late as 1784 a Loyalist accused of wartime acts of cruelty was killed by a mob upon returning to his home community in South Carolina, and in Boston a returning Loyalist was tarred-and-feathered the same year. Continued expressions of loyalty to the crown would have been met with risk of expulsion from the town or the state, threats of violence, or actual violence up to and including lynching. A hold-out community of Loyalists, if it existed, would have been seen as a military threat and dealt with accordingly, however to respond again to your question, I have never heard of an organized Loyalist community holding out after Yorktown, when it was apparent that the UK government was not going to commit any further British troops to protect the Loyalists. Those who thought re-integration in the face of Patriot hostility was impossible left the US. The Loyalists who chose to remain in America had to keep their heads down and hope for slow recovery of their pre-war economic and social position. \nAn excellent reference for this topic which I've drawn from is:\nHoock, H (2017) *Scars of Independence: America's Violent Birth*"}}

They also had good reason to try and conquer Mapuche areas - \n\"Dillehay and Gordon (1988:230) sustain that 'the attraction of silver and gold was the  \nfactor that most intensely motivated the Incas to penetrate the southern forests (of  \nChile) and to extend their frontier of social and economic activities.'...there exist diverse authors who registered the existence of those metals in \\[Mapuche lands\\]...\"\nIt seems like the Inca were soundly defeated by Mapuche forces, and then *still* had economic reason to continue interactions with the Mapuche in order to obtain valuable resources.^(1)\nFor the northern border, you write:\n&gt;the northern edges were made up of groups so poor they were not actually a net gain for Tahuantinsuyu's economy\nCan you provide some specific sources for this? The presence of powerful and wealthy Andean societies definitely continued past the northern Inca frontier - consider the [Muisca Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisca_Confederation). I'd also note that there seem to have been cases where extremely successful Inca conquerors failed in certain areas and then justified failures by saying that their enemies were effectively unworthy of being conquered.^(2)  The lice story sounds like it might be a version of this.\nFor the eastern border, you're definitely right that the Inca had trouble invading lower Amazonia, and groups like the Shuar mounted effective resistances that likely weren't based on controlled, centralized military efforts. However, I just want to talk a little bit about your framing:\n&gt;The Inca referred to people living beyond their eastern borders as mana apuyoc, \"Men without a leader.\" It's tough to negotiate with people who don't even have someone who can speak for the whole group...there did not seem to be a great appetite to subjugate people who could just retreat into the forest forever while shooting arrows the whole way.\nAgain, what you wrote isn't incorrect. However, with statements like \"people who don't even have someone who can speak for the whole group\" I think that it does something similar to \"the Inca couldn't conquer this area because the people they were trying to conquer weren't advanced enough to truly interact/negotiate with.\" But the reality is that the strategies groups like the Shuar were undertaking were clearly incredibly effective. They stopped Inca expansion, and later prevented Spanish conquests. \n&amp;#x200B;\n^(1) [https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/18d85730-4f3b-49cd-a501-6393a6d4a659](https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/18d85730-4f3b-49cd-a501-6393a6d4a659)  \n^(2) [https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/0106\\_28Ecuador.pdf](https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/0106_28Ecuador.pdf)"}}

First, I am a newer listener to the show - I think I started with the History of American policing series which was mentioned on a different history podcast. It's become one of my \"listen the day it appears in the queue\" podcasts, mostly because I'm struck by his and his guests' ability to laugh about topics without it ever sounding like they're laughing at those harmed by the subject of their episode. He always seems exceptionally aware of power dynamics among groups and seems to be very thoughtful about how he talks about those who wield and are subject to different levels of power, especially within movements. (The most recent example that comes to mind, was in the middle of an episode about Pick Up Artists and incels, he realized that the author of a guide he was reading cold was a young man, clearly dealing with some difficult stuff, and immediately apologized and moved the conversation away from the young man's writing.) \nAs someone who listens to an [obnoxious amount of history podcasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lgu6ws/short_answers_to_simple_questions_february_10_2021/gmvj4vq/), I feel comfortable saying I've never gotten the sense that, unlike other high-profile amateur history podcast hosts, he takes himself seriously as a researcher nor that he expects his readers to view him as an expert on the topics. Rather, he chooses a path for a particular argument about a person he wants to make and follows research he finds online to support it. And, I suspect, for most of his episodes, he does a fairly good job of constructing an argument that, generally speaking, matches what historians who study the topic would endorse or support. The challenge, however, is in the details.\nBy delightful coincidence, his [recent episode on Nestle](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/how-nestle-starved-a-bunch-of-85687280/) happened to drop right as I was in the middle of working on a project related to the history of breastfeeding in America. I read multiple books, articles, listened to podcast interviews with historians, etc. on the topic and was deeply immersed in the intricacies of feeding small humans for days at a time. I will offer that none of those authors are listed in his reference list. Which is fine, because it's not an episode about the history of feeding infants (he even says it's not meant to be a history of wet nursing), it's about a particular event. Funny enough, though, he clearly consulted sources that aren't listed. I recognized a quote from [this Medium article](https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/the-tragic-plight-of-enslaved-wet-nurses-b1c80b73f290) (which is very much not written by a historian - if someone had posted that article as an answer on AskHistorians, it would have been removed) that doesn't appear on his list. \nAt the beginning of the episode, he offers some context about enslaved women and nursing that is ... not wrong. It's also woefully incomplete. The relationship between enslaved women and white woman and their infants varied dramatically between plantations and communities. For every enslaver who forced enslaved women to feed infants that weren't their own, including the enslaver's own children, there were enslavers who felt white babies would be harmed by being fed by an enslaved woman. Meanwhile, there were white women enslavers who routinely fed enslaved babies who needed more milk than their mother could provide and others who handed their babies off to an enslaved woman, indentured servant, or paid wetnurse for feedings as soon as the baby was born. So... it's a lot more complicated than a single section of a single podcast episode can cover.\nShortly after that history, he references \"dry-nursing.\" I suspect he got the word from this article on his reference list, *[A concise history of infant formula \\(twists and turns included\\)](https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/concise-history-infant-formula-twists-and-turns-included)* - **bolding is mine**\n&gt; Eventually, wet nursing fell out of favor, and attention turned to finding an adequate substitute for mother's milk.^2 **The practice of feeding human babies milk from animals, called dry nursing, began to flourish in the 19th century. Milk from a variety animals - goats, cows, mares, and donkeys - was used.** Cow's milk became the most widely used because of its ready availability (although donkey's milk was thought to be healthier because its appearance most closely resembled that of human milk). \nUnfortunately, the author of that piece - and then the host of the podcast - get it a bit sideways. Generally speaking \"dry-nursing\" referred to the act of a woman caring for a baby or infant who was not her own and doing everything except feeding the baby her own milk. The woman performing that role was known as a \"dry-nurse\" but more commonly, especially in America, as a \"nurse\" or a \"nursemaid\" (unless she was an enslaved woman, then she might be referred to as a \"mammy\") and the use of the word \"dry\" was used to distinguish her from a caregiver who could feed the baby herself, AKA a \"wet nurse.\" It didn't always mean the baby would be fed animal milk, but it might, depending on the specific conditions. As far as I can tell, there was no specific word that referred to feeding babies only animal milk. I won't get into the entire history of big humans using animal milk to keep small humans alive but it's safe to say humans have always done it. \nAll of which is to say, when the host said \"dry-nursing\" refers to feeding babies animal milk, he was mistaken. Instead, in most contexts when \"dry nursing\" was used, it was because the person caring for the baby did not directly feed the baby their own milk. In other words, there's a linguistic and historical line from *dry-nurse* --&gt; *mother's helper* --&gt; *babysitter* as seen in these newspaper ads from Dublin in 1853:\n&gt; As Dry Nurse, a steady, respectable young Woman, of regular habits, who has a perfect knowledge of-her business, would undertake the care of a baby from its birth, or a couple of growing up children; has long and satisfactory discharges and lived with some of the first families; .can be highly recommended by her last mistress; understands hair, dressing perfectly well; has no encumbrance whatever, would have no objection to a country family. \n&gt; AS Dry Nurse, a steady, active Woman, who has had much experience during the past eight years, both in the capacity of wet and dry nurse can take charge of a baby from its birth, or of growing up children; understands the management of a nursery, plain work, and making up of fine things; can be well recommended by her last mistress and other ladies at present in town with whom she lived.\nWe can see uses of \"dry-nursing\" discussed by physicians in the 1800s, but implied in that usage was that someone other than the mother would be feeding the baby. I don't begrudge the host of BtB for not understanding or recognizing the nuance around the topic. I wouldn't recommend, though, treating his historical analysis as the final word on a given topic or subject. But what happened to him - and the author of the piece he cited - is not uncommon. In fact, it made a collection of anecdotes about times a judge or lawyer was stymied by a word that appeared in a New York State newspaper in 1901:\n&gt; 'Another dilemma was produced a little while ago on the western circuit by the introduction of the words \"dry nurse\" in an address to the court. This bewildered the Judge, who asked if a dry nurse was a nurse who dried babies after they had been washed. That solution did not occur to the learned counsel, who, after some hesitation, said he thought it meant a nurse who was not addicted to drinking and therefore most suitable to look after infants. Nobody seemed to know what the term really meant, though several more guesses were made, the last of them that a dry nurse was one who could not amuse children."}}

However, there was a relatively recent conference (2015) about the findings of Roman coins in a medieval context, so I can borrow the conclusions of some of the participants. \nBasically, the minting and circulation of bronze coins survived the disappearance of the Western Roman Empire in various regions of Europe. There was still bronze coinage of different sources (Visigoth, Vandal, Byzantine and Burgundian) available in the Mediterranean area until the 6th or 7th century. There was a regular circulation of Byzantine bronze coins in Gaul and Brittany in the 6th and 7th centuries, and of Arab ones in south-western Gaul in the 8th century. And Roman bronze coins themselves were circulating in certain regions of the Mediterranean area until the 7th century, in Spain and more notably in Italy. The use of such coins as currency is not attested with certainty after the 8th century (Cardon, 2016; Marani, 2016).\nThe problem that has puzzled medievalists for decades is that Roman coins can be found in many medieval sites, and archeologists keep finding them in such sites. In France, Roman coins were known and used during the Merovingian period: tombs frequently include such coins deposited with the deceased. There, they are typically used as jewellery (necklaces, pendants) or associated with other objects in an alms box. In this case, their use appear to be votive or ornemental, not monetary. Roman coins are also found in medieval \"treasures\", ie money deposits, usually mixed with more recent coins (Cardon, 2016; Genevi\u00e8ve, 2016). In their study of the knights-peasants of the Lake of Paladru (11th century, Is\u00e8re, South-east France), Collardelle and Verdel (1993) noted the presence of Roman coins among the medieval ones and wondered whether those coins were used for ornemental purpose (to make jewellery) or as simple change, perhaps as supplemental coins.\nIn 1973, George Duby wrote that the medieval use of Roman coins was unlikely, if only because those bronze coins were fragile and deteriorated quickly and would disappear within a century. Today, the general consensus does not seem to have modified Duby's conclusion (except that there are much more data about Roman coins in the medieval period): Roman coins were well known in Europe long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, but whether they were used for something else than for votive or ornemental purposes is not proven. They had value, and may have perhaps been used as occasional tokens, but so far nothing proves that they were used as *money*.\nNow if we skip a few centuries, something interesting happened. In the 18th and 19th centuries, historians, archeologists, and antique dealers / collectors touring the European countryside looking for interesting artifacts were encountering peasant communities who had a surprising knowledge of Roman coins: they kept finding them in their fields. There are many testimonies about this in several European countries. I've only looked for examples in France, Belgium, and Germany, but there is no doubt that peasants in Great Britain, Spain, and of course Italy were finding Roman coins. \nAccording to Abbot Cochet, writing in 1855, French peasants often picked up Roman coins in their field, calling them *sous de la Vierge*, the Virgin's coins. Since they could not legally use them, they put them in the church poor box or gave them to the priest when he was taking offerings after the service. Cochet says that he knew several priests with a nice collection of Roman artifacts. Ethnologist and folklorist Henri Gaidoz reported a burial practice still in use in some areas of 19th century France that consisted in placing a coin in the hand of the deceased: in one reported instance, the coin was a Roman coin (Gaidoz, 1900).\nIn Bavay (northern France, next to the Belgian border), antique dealer Albert de Bouvette found that local peasants found Roman coins in large numbers, and had a name for them, less Christian than the one reported by Cochet: the *Mahomets* (the name of the Muslim prophet in French) and it looks that they had a business selling *Mahomets* to the local notary (Bouvette, 1852). In 1850, archeologist de Torquat reported that the peasants of Bazoches-les-Hautes (near Chartres) had named a field the *Champ de la Fortune*, the Field of Fortune, due to the numerous Roman artifacts found there. Coins could be collected in a radius of about 4 km around the field. In 1860, Belgian archeologist Charles-Louis Ruelens, writing about the Caves of Han-sur-Lesse, in Wallonia, was told that these caves and others in the region contained coins left by Roman soldiers. Since at least the mid-1700s, peasants regularly explored the caves to find the coins, and they would sell them to collectors in Li\u00e8ge. A tragic story told to Ruelens was that of a young peasant who had disappeared after he had gone to find Roman coins. Those coins would have made him rich enough to buy the cow and the twelve sheep he needed to get married. Six years later, the man's remains were found in the Cave of Han, a few coins next to him.\nBut what about the direct monetary use of Roman coins in the modern era? There are two examples. \nIn 1824, Bavarian parish priest Franz Anton Mayer, in a book about Roman coins in Bavaria, said that in the previous century, a large field near Gnotzheim, next to the [Danubian Limes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danubian_Limes), was particularly rich in Roman coins, including silver and gold ones. The coins surfaced when one ploughed the land and when it rained. By the mid-1700s, the local peasants had collected so many of them that they \"bought their beer at the tavern using Roman money\".\nA second example was used by Eugen Weber in his classic work *Peasants into Frenchmen* as an example of the autarky and isolation of French peasantry in the early 19th century. The source of that story was Alfred Bertrand (1826-1912), curator of the Departmental Museum of the Allier in 1910. Bertrand's testimony was collected by local historian Henriette Dussourd:\n&gt;I remember the period from 1834 to 1852, when the billon coins were demonetized. The farmers of Yzeure found in the ground thousands of small, medium or large Roman bronze coins. They cleaned them and put them into circulation where they were accepted as liards, two liards, simple *sous* or double ten centimes.  The bakers, butchers, grocers and butchers of the town had large quantities of them, and it was easy to collect them. The silver coins of the same period were sold for fifty centimes or one franc, according to their type, whether they were of Faustina, Caesar or Hadrian. As for the other bronze objects, they were delivered to the first \"pillero\" [possibly scrap dealer] passing by while the gold coins were always sold and melted down by goldsmiths. \nThis practice ceased in the mid-1850s with the passing of copper coinage. \nSo: Roman coins never completely fell out of use. After they stopped being used as money in the Early Middle Ages, they were recycled as ornemental or votive objects used in traditional ceremonies, and, later, some (literally) resurfaced as valuable and collectible items, and their final use as currency ended in the 1850s.\n**Sources**\n* Bouvette, Albert d\u2019Otreppe de.

This would be a huge benefit to all.\nAs a teacher, there is a principle that comprehension is often more important than accuracy, and in some cases an oversimplification or other heuristics is a great starting off point in learning something new.  And as you learn more, the corrections in accuracy become more and more important. \nSince most of you are academic writers, I understand that there is a very strict mindset one must have in order to be as accurate as possible (lest you be destroyed by your colleagues).

And that's where this subreddit seems to break down, and instead the focus turns on only answering questions that have a clear answer. Because after ten years, every one of these kinds of questions has already been asked and answered.\nI think this subreddit should actually try to reach out to subs like r/history or r/AskHistory (at the very least, link them in the FAQ, wiki, or about section so casual buffs can head there), or work with them to both ensure misinformation isn't being spread on theirs and redirect academic answers to here.\nSomething tells me, however, that at least one historian will reply with, \"We don't care about raising general knowledge and interest in history.

Fingers crossed I cited enough for the mods.\nAs is often the case with fashion, how a particular trend came to be a cornerstone relies on several reinforcements over time. Although I'm certain there are even more reinforcements I'm not aware of, let's focus on how the 70s, 80s, and 90s reinforced tracksuit love in different ways.\n*First let's take a stroll down memory lane with general clothing production issues in the 1970s:*\nAlthough the USSR had subsidies for children's clothes, adult clothes were largely difficult and expensive to buy^(1) due to limitations of in-state producers and artisans coupled with the obvious ban on imported consumer goods. Two-thirds of an average worker's wages would have been devoted to food and clothing with the latter being scarce as the USSR focused on investment over production. The USSR tried to confront the issue several times after the population failed to make their own clothing as initially recommended. In a decade's time (mid-1960s to mid-1970s) clothing production had increased by 2.5x, however the demand was still far higher than the production.^(2) \nJust because you lived in the USSR did not mean brand name was meaningless to you. We can see this with the incredibly popular Levi jeans which would have cost you about 200 rubles ($270 USD).^(3) Despite this price point and difficulty in buying an American brand, Levis were seen in the USSR fashion especially that of youths. Any foreign brand name you wanted would be very expensive *if* you could get it. Even if you don't care about brands another thing to consider is that most of the USSR is *quite* cold meaning you would need heavy (expensive) winter clothes. So how do people keep their expensive and hard to find clothes nice? The way that many societies have throughout time - house clothes. At home women would have changed into an outfit consisting of a simple dress and for men it would have been what we think of as track clothes today (a sweatshirt and loose pants).\n*Oh, how I love old memories, but if we were to pop in a tv-recorded VHS from 1980 we might see a fraction of a big event many countries boycotted:* The 1980 Olympics in Moscow. Clothing was still in high demand and production was not at a pre-soviet level, but obviously the home team needed to look sharp. You would have to recognize it by its iconic stripes because the USSR's team stripped the logos right off the German-made Adidas tracksuits they donned.^(4) These Olympic tracksuits had a clear impact on Soviet fashion trends, but only insomuch as any Olympic event would have on the host country.\n*Ring, ring, ring... what's that? The 90s just called and let me know that jogging is cool now.* That's right - up until the late 80s/early 90s jogging for exercise was not that common. As it became popular as a hobby so did fashion surrounding jogging which of course included tracksuits. This new style of athletic clothes for the average person became popular worldwide and just like with denim in the 70s - Soviets wanted it. Similar to the example of Levis in the 70s, name brand athletic clothes also would have been incredibly expensive. So expensive, in fact, they become a status symbol and who loves status more than gangsters? \nAlthough the USSR had \"fallen,\" the black market created by rising demand and stifling production lived on giving plenty of opportunities for a gopnik to make a dime. And what does a gopnik wear you might ask? Only the finest brand name clothes which naturally includes the coveted adidas tracksuit.^(5) \nSo now we have a fashion that grew from the necessity of comfy and cheap house clothes and then became mainstream through athletics. Many soviets would have grown up wearing house clothes and associating them with comfort and home, once that fashion became a status symbol all bets were off. Who doesn't want to be comfortable and look expensive?\n&amp;#x200B;\n1. Cook, L. J. (1993).

I don't believe there's any indication that *Bretwalda* was an actual title which could be claimed, by vote or otherwise. Rather, I'm under the impression that it's essentially Bede's term for the hegemon among the Heptarchs (also a retrospective term) at any one point.\nNeither am I aware of recent literature drawing an unbroken organizational line of continuity between the *Bretwalda* and the West Saxon government, or one ending with Knutr. Indeed, George Molyneaux has traced various forms of centralization from the early-mid-10th century.^(1) Sarah Foot has called Aethelstan (r. 924-939) the first true \"King of England\", ruling as he did an essentially unified single state and calling himself *Rex Anglorum*, \"King of the English\", in 928.^(2)\nFurthermore, there seems to be rather a lot of controversy about whether the *Witan* was a single institution, or a generic term referring to royal councils.^(3) As such, I'd personally be uncomfortable with claiming that \"Anglo Saxons ran more of an oligarchy or constitutional monarchy called the Witanagemot\"^(4) which \"functioned like a Parliament\", something J. R. Maddicott explicitly denies.^(5) Even by the reign of Alfred the Great, we see the *Witan* being quite bluntly used by the monarch.^(6)\nWhile the *Witan* did have to approve the succession of the king in Wessex, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom for which we have the best evidence, I don't think many historians believe this makes these monarchies in any sense \"elective\" or \"constitutional\" (they had no constitutions, to our knowledge). This was mostly formality, and I am not aware of any case in which a *Witan* refused to approve/elect a successor of the blood.\nI'm happy to stand corrected, but I do wonder if perhaps the narrative of a clear break between the West Saxon and Norman kings, such that it is justified to call the latter but not the former \"Kings of England\", is a little too simplistic.\nIn any case, I know it's not a good source, but Wikipedia actually *does* list the first \"English monarch\" as Alfred the Great (r. 871/878-899), so I wouldn't personally be sure that this question relies on a fully sound premise. When I google \"first king of england\", the top result is Aethelstan, also listed as such in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. This suggests to me that academic ideas like Foot's have at least some popular validity, and it's not unequivocally true that (as the questioner states) \"they\" (to whomever this refers) \"don\u2019t \\[...\\] recognize the previous kings of Anglo Saxons\".\nI'm afraid I can't add much on where certain conceptions of Anglo-Saxon history came from, but I hope to clarify or gain clarification on certain points of Anglo-Saxon history itself.\n**References**\n^(1) Molyneaux, George. 2015. *The Formation of the English Kingdom in the Tenth Century*.

In short: vacuum tubes. To a lesser extent, cameras and bacteriophage treatments. And though not in the USSR, East German motorcycles. Czech beer is an unsettled question, it would seem. \nHowever, to answer your question about the hypothetical official in Tanzania: Tanzania may not be the best example, because there was a only a small, if consistent, amount of trade between the USSR and Tanzania. From independence in 1961 until his resignation in 1985, Tanzania was governed by Julius Nyerere, who developed and adhered to an only semi-Marx-influenced strand of utopian African socialism called *ujamaa*, and when he did draw on Marxian socialism, he was mostly influenced by the Maoist approach to collectivization, so Tanzania and the USSR never became particularly close. You might say that Soviet industrial and consumer goods were therefore not in demand in Tanzania, but it wouldn't be because they were bad quality. At least, not primarily.\nWe can still look at Soviet trade with the world as a whole, though (and let's narrow it down to the '60s and '70s, as the period of stable, \"mature\" socialist production that you probably have in mind, because otherwise it's impossible to generalize). The *real* reason why you won't find a ton of Soviet industrial machinery or consumer goods outside of the Eastern Bloc is simply that they didn't care that much about producing enough to export, or to give as aid, that far afield. The key Soviet exports to the developing world were always grain and oil \u2014 machinery mostly stayed in Europe and the Union itself.\nThat is, though, \"mostly\" in proportion to everything that was produced in the USSR. Comparatively small amounts of machinery, but hardly insignificant amounts to the countries that received them, were sent to several countries. I can't find raw numbers of tractors or anything, but a large majority of the material that the USSR shipped to Pakistan and India, for example, was composed of machinery, and significant amounts also went to the Middle East and Africa. I haven't been able to find references to their quality in the kinds of academic history books I really would prefer to cite.\nThat said, though, when all else fails, might as well just go type it into JStor, and I found a few articles on there, written back in the '60s, '70s and '80s in politics journals, that described Soviet aid to the rest of the world as a topic of current affairs. And though these are really more primary sources than secondary at this point, and as a result, we should recognize that they might be a bit tendentious, they do say that Soviet industrial machinery was not exactly \"competitive\" with Western goods. That's not to say it was uniformly poor in quality \u2014 just that it wasn't seen as an attractive purchase by the states in question.\n___\nSources:\nBjerk, Paul. *Julius Nyerere*.

For the desirability of paleness we could also look to Theocritus Idyll 10.26-7, where Boucaeus sings about Bombyca, whom he loves: \n\u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u1f7b\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u1f77\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, \u03a3\u1f7b\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f73\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u1f77 \u03c4\u03c5 \u03c0\u1f71\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2,   \n\u1f30\u03c3\u03c7\u03bd\u1f71\u03bd, \u1f01\u03bb\u03b9\u1f79\u03ba\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bc\u1f79\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u1f77\u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd.   \n\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f76 \u1f34\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u1f73\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u1f77, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f01 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f51\u1f71\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2\u0387   \n\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u2019 \u1f14\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u1f71\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bb\u1f73\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. \nBeautiful Bombyca, all call you Syrian,   \nlean, sun-burnt \u2013 but I alone call you honey-coloured.   \nAnd the violet is dark, and the inscribed hyacinth:   \nbut still, in garlands they are chosen first.\n&amp;#x200B;\nBoucaeus implies that the dark skin of Bombyca makes her unattractive to others, though he has said nothing before this to suggest this is in fact the case. And at any rate, he nevertheless views her as beautiful \u2013 and given Boucaeus is very clearly a stand-in for Theocritus in this poem (his name is evocative of bucolics, the name of Theocritus\u2019 genre), and the person Boucaeus is talking to has stereotypically trash opinions about women, I think we are to read this as Theocritus arguing that paleness is not a measure of beauty. Nor in other authors do we find paleness as necessarily a quality to be desired in a woman. Indeed, in the archaic lyric poets such as Sappho and Anacreon, whiteness is typically a negative quality, applied to the poet, that suggests their unattractiveness. So, famously, in Sappho 31.14-16: \n...\t\t\u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u1f73\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03bf\u1f77\u03b1\u03c2   \n\u1f14\u03bc\u03bc\u03b9, \u03c4\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u1f71\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd \u03b4\u2019 \u1f40\u03bb\u1f77\u03b3\u03c9 \u2019\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u1f7b\u03c3\u03b7\u03bd   \n   \u03c6\u03b1\u1f77\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u2019 \u1f14\u03bc\u2019 \u03b1\u1f54\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ...\t\t\t\nI am paler than the grass,   \nand I seem to myself to be only   \n   a little from death\n&amp;#x200B;\nSappho contrasts her own paleness with the vibrant beauty of the girl she loves (whose skin-colour is left undescribed). More explicitly, in Sappho 16.17-18 she talks about Anactoria:\n\u03c4\u1fb6\\]\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b5 \u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u1f77\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd \u1f14\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f79\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03b2\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1   \n\u03ba\u1f00\u03bc\u1f71\u03c1\u03c5\u03c7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bb\u1f71\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u1f7d\u03c0\u03c9 \nI would prefer to see her lovely dancing   \nand the shining radiance of her face\n&amp;#x200B;\nAgain, the idea is of a shining brilliance, not a kind of paleness. And at Sappho 58B.3-4, whiteness is again characterised as a negative, unattractive feature characteristic of old age: \n\u1f10\u03bc\u03bf\u1f76 \u03b4\u2019 \u1f04\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u1f77\u03bd\\] \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u2019 \\[\u1f14\\]\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c1\u1f79\u03b1 \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f24\u03b4\u03b7   \n\u03ba\u1f71\u03c1\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u1f71\u03bb\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b5\u1fe6\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u2019 \u1f10\u03b3\\]\u1f73\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03c1\u1f77\u03c7\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u1f77\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \nMy skin, once upon a time tender, old age already   \nbadly withers, and my hair has turned white from black\n&amp;#x200B;\nSappho\u2019s loss of colour corresponds to her loss of beauty, and her consequent unattractiveness. Similar ideas can also be found in Anacreon 358, in which both Eros and the girl Anacreon is attracted to are characterised by their colour, while he \u2013 who is spurned by the woman \u2013 is characterised only by the whiteness of his hair. Nor is paleness universally desired by the Latin poets, as Catullus makes clear in poem 86: \nQuintia formosa est multis, mihi candida, longa,   \nrecta est. haec ego sic singula confiteor,   \ntotum illud \u201cformosa\u201d nego: nam nulla venustas,   \nnulla in tam magno est corpore mica salis.   \nLesbia formosa est, quae cum pulcherrima tota est, \nTo many, Quintia is beautiful; to me, she is gleaming white, tall,   \ngraceful. I will admit each of these.   \nBut I deny that all that is \u2018beuatiful\u2019: for there is no Venus-ness,   \nnot a grain of wit in all that tall body.   \nLesbia is beautiful, for as a whole she is the prettiest\n&amp;#x200B;\nThe gleaming whiteness of Quintia is no match for Lesbia, who is attractive both for her looks (implicitly not whiter than white) and her wit. In fact, Ovid suggests why poets in particular might not find paleness attractive \u2013 in Amores 1.8, a procuress addresses one of her prostitutes to give her some advice (lines 35-6): \nErubuit. 'decet alba quidem pudor ora, sed iste,   \nsi simules, prodest; verus obesse solet. \nShe blushed. \u201cIndeed a white face suits modesty, and that,   \nif you can fake it, helps: the truth tends to get in the way.\n&amp;#x200B;\nBut most of the poets \u2013 and most lovers \u2013 don\u2019t want a modest girl. Whiteness is suggestive of innocence, purity, and virginity, all of which make for a terrible lover (particularly within the generic constraints of elegiac poetry). So Catullus only uses whiteness to characterise a woman as beautiful in poem 61, a wedding-song (lines 9, 194), and this is because here her virginity is important. And so this takes us back to the paintings and artwork. Visual art is characterised by its typologised figures \u2013 to create vivid contrasts and to easily differentiate the characters, various characteristics become entrenched as shorthands to help the audience identify the subjects. And so it is unhelpful if you make both men and women look the same, as they generally do; instead \u2013 given the figure of the Greek male is the default \u2013 you differentiate the women by giving them a different skin-tone. Whiteness is reflective of Greco-Roman ideals for women, particularly their passivity and virginal status, and so this is used in art to characterise them and distinguish them from the men. The paleness of women does not denote their attractiveness, nor reality, but rather the behaviour expected of them by the patriarchal society in which they lived.\nSecondary literature: you\u2019ve asked really about two massive questions, so the potential reading out there is massive, and this is a very limited sample\nChristopoulous, M., Karakantza, E.

They also crossed the Alps, and settled in the diaspora up to some towns in England and to the low countries like Bruges. *The Merchant's Handbook*, compiled by the Florentine Merchant ~~in~~ (sorry for a silly mistypo) Pegolotti in 1340s, made a note on which part of England the high quality woolen product was produced as well as where across Europe the fair was regularly held. \nSince this establishment of the direct maritime route to the Mediterranean and of Italian merchants' diaspora settlement, Bruges developed primarily as the commercial as well as financial hub of North-Western Europe. When the Pope had to transport the money as well as the goods from Northern Europe either to Avignon or to Rome for collecting the crusader tax or some fees from local churchmen, he generally assigned the merchant who had a branch office in Bruges as his agent. \nYou also had merchant branch office in 14th century Bruges mainly of two powerful Italian cities, Venice and Genoa, to negotiate your goods to the Balkans, another problem rose here: While Genoan merchants generally had dominance in the Western Mediterranean and the Atlantic route up to the Black Death, Venice had a stronger connection in the Balkans due to her involvement with the Byzantine Empire. In the 13th century, Venice built oversea 'colonies' in ex-Byzantine Empire across the Eastern Mediterranean, but Genoa competed their political dominance vehemently, especially in the Black Sea where both the important local product like alum and the product from the Silk road were available. Venice also established the regular maritime trade route to Bruges in 1325 onward, but if OP lived in the early decades in the 14th century, they might have had difficulty in finding the Italian merchant in Brugge who had a local connection also in the Balkans.  \nReferences:  \n* Mollat du Jordan, Michel. *L'Europe et la mer*.

R\u00f6hrig was drafted in the Napoleonic Army in 1812 and participated in several battles, including the Battle of Leipzig (October 1813). He was honourably discharged in 1814 with the rank of *sergent-major*, returned home to be a schoolteacher again. He later wrote his memoirs, which were edited and published in 1906 by his grandson Karl. The original quote goes like this:\n&gt; War alles entmutigt, und er kam geritten, so wirkte seine Gegenwart wie ein elektrischer Schlag. Alles schrie aus Herzensgrunde: Vive l'Empereur !\" und ging blind ins Feuer. (If all were demoralized and he appeared riding, his presence was like an electric shock. All shouted \u201cVive l'Empereur!\u201d and everyone charged blindly into the fire.)\nR\u00f6hrig admired Napoleon but he was a little bit critical here, as he failed to understand how \"such a clever commander, as the Emperor was\", could let his troops go without food for so long... The \"electric shock\" he was talking about helped to wake up men who were not just \"demoralized\", but also \"half-starved and weary\" (*halb-verhungerten und matten*).\nWhile we cannot be totally sure that R\u00f6hrig's text was not slightly rewritten by his grandson, the mention of an \"electric shock\" used is not anachronistic for a text written by an educated European (such as R\u00f6hrig was) in the first half of the nineteenth century. The \"electric shock\" he talked about did not refer to being electrocuted by accident at home. This would not be possible until the last decades of the century when electricity became available for domestic use. But, in the early 19th century, electricity had been used for more than fifty years for another purpose: medicine. \nIn 1745-1746, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek (with his assistant Andreas  Cunaeus) separately invented the Leyden jar, and all received unpleasant electric shocks in the process, complete with pretty light effects. They found this totally amazing, immediately wrote letters to their colleagues, and soon enough European scientists were happy to electrocute themselves, like Abbot Jean-Antoine Nollet, then the leading specialist of electricity in France (Nollet, 1746):\n&gt; You will feel a very strong and sudden *commotion* in both arms, and even in the chest and the rest of the body.\nAnd the more the merrier!\n&gt; Instead of having the same person holding the vessel draw the spark, as in the preceding experiment, form a chain of thirty or forty men holding hands; or if you do not have enough people, have one man communicate with another man by means of an iron rod, of which they will each hold one end: let the first of the group hold the vessel half full of water under the metal wire, and let the last draw the spark from the iron rod. All those who take part in this experiment will feel at the same time the *commotion* which is its ordinary effect. This succeeded perfectly with two hundred men, who formed two rows, each of which was more than one hundred and fifty feet long; and I have no doubt that the same success would be achieved with two thousand or more.\nIn Geneva, Jean Jallabert started a series of experiments that would be frowned upon by an ethical board today (Jallabert, 1748):\n&gt; The astonishing vivacity of a fire which cannot be better compared to that of lightning; that incredible phenomenon of a jar pierced by the action of electricity; the terrible commotion felt by the person who fired the spark; all this had impressed on the spectators a terror which allowed neither them nor myself to expose any of them to a second test.\nHe then electrocuted several animals (after removing hairs or feathers on the contact point): some died instantly, others several minutes later, and other survived but \"seemed strongly incommodated\". On 26 December 1746, Jallabert made the first attempt at electrotherapy on Mr. Nogu\u00e8s, 52, a master locksmith who was paralyzed in one arm since an accident that had happened 13 years earlier. During the next two months, Jallabert applied electric shocks or ran a mild electric current in Nogu\u00e8s' atrophied arm, and eventually restored the limb to (partial) health.\nIn the following decades, doctors and scientists in France, Italy, Germany, and Britain used electricity to treat all ailments known at the time: paralysis, rheumatism, deafness, toothache, various eye diseases, St Vitus' dance, lockjaw, epilepsy, scrofula, fevers, menstrual disorders, sciatica, gout, cancerous tumors, abscesses, hydropisy, squinancy (peritonsillar abscess), urinary retention, sprains, frostbite, sore throat, lethargy, hemorrhoids, asthma etc. The three main methods were the \"electric bath\" (not a real bath, but a bath of \"electrical fluid\", ie the patient was used to conduct electricity), the \"sparks\" method, and the commotion method (pictures are shown at the end of [Mauduyt's book](https://books.google.fr/books?id=eFhpAAAAcAAJ) here), but there were many others (friction...). In 1784, reviews by Mauduyt de la Varenne and Jean-Paul Marat (yes, [that Marat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Marat)) showed that the efficiency of \"electrification\" was... variable, notably for the commotion method, which, according to Marat, was often followed by blood spitting (when applied to the chest), or \"convulsions, often loss of sight and sometimes death\" (when applied to the head). Marat, who electrocuted \"for mankind\" several pigeons, a cat and a dog to study this method, reminded this readers that electric shocks had been used abusively, resulting in the deaths of many people and in miscarriages. Still, he concluded that electrotherapy, while dangerous if violent, was useful, at least for certain diseases, and recommended treatment by friction, sparks or shocks.\nSo, without going into the later history of electrotherapy and the popularisation of electricity through public demonstrations (which involved shocks and sparks, see Morus, 1998), it can be said that the notion of \"electric shock\" (a term used in French since the late 18th century) was well understood in the early 19th century, and that it had a curative aspect.\n**Sources**\n* Recueil sur l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale.

Akkadian and Sumerian were not mutually intelligible, though they did share a very close relationship for a few millennia.\nAkkadian is a semitic language, related to modern Hebrew and Arabic languages. Like those languages, it uses the conjugation of three consonants to form verbs, nouns and adjectives, called consonatal roots. It was originally the language spoken by the semitic peoples of Northern Mesopotamia, including later Assyria and Babylon and the city-state of Akkad. \nSumerian is the language of the earliest city-states in Southern Mesopotamia, the originally named Sumerians. The language has no surviving relatives and even at the time of its use there are no attested relatives which have been written down. It is an Agglutinative language, using a complex system of Ergativity and case markers in Verbal and Nominal chains, which in many cases are still not fully understood. It may have had tonality as well, though this idea has begun to fall out of favour.\nSumerian was the first written language in Mesopotamia, perhaps the entire world, depending on whether you ask an assyriologist or and egyptologist. It was widely used for the recording of trade and production from 3500BCE and later developed into a fully-realised writing system for the recording of real speech. For this reason, it was employed outside of Sumeria, including in Akkadian territory, where it was used for the recording of both Sumerian and of Akkadian. Much of the religious writing of the time took place in Sumerian, as even by this point, the Akkadians lent a gravitas to Sumerian much as we did in Europe to Latin, as the language of the bible. \nThis link is likely compounded by the presence of Sumerian traders and envoys in Akkadian lands and vice versa, so there would have been some measure of bilingualism in the region, though perhaps only amongst educated classes. \nNow, with the rise of Sargon  (\ud808\udeac\ud808\ude92\ud808\udd00 akkadian: \u0160arrugi) the first emperor of the Akkadian empire, an usurper who changed his name to literally mean \"rightful king\", the Akkadians came to rule the Sumerian city-states in the South. This accelerated the spread of bilingualism in the region as Akkadians and Sumerians moved about within the empire. What developed from that time onwards has been called a Sprachbund, an area where the languages, though not necessarily mutually intelligible, display a large amount of borrowed words between them. It is believed that during this time, most people would be able to speak at least a bit of both languages.\nOne interesting example of this would be the Sumerian word 'Gina', meaning 'reed'. It entered Akkadian as 'Qan\u00fb', which entered Greek during the time of Alexander's heirs and 'K\u00e1nna', then into Latin as 'Canna', old French 'Cane' to modern English 'Cane'.\nEventually, after the 'Ur III' period (a resurgence of culturally Sumerian rule in the region) came to an end, Sumerian would slowly die out as a spoken language, existing only as latin does today, in religious and mythological texts and used widely in monumental inscriptions. Babylonians, such as Hammurabi, would often use 'Sumerograms', which are cuneiform symbols written in Akkadian texts meant to be read using their Sumerian meanings. This was done in order to lend gravity and a sense of timelessness to the writing.\nIt is important to note that Akkadian didn't remain Akkadian, but diverged into different languages, Assyrian and Babylonian, the latter being heavily influenced by the Amorites, who took control of the region of Babylon, Hammurabi was an Amorite.\nAshurbarnipal, king of Assyria, once boasted \"I, Ashurbarnipal, within the palace, understood the wisdom of Nabu. All the art of writing of every kind. I made myself the master of them all. I read the tablets of Sumer and the dark Akkadian language which is difficult to rightly use; I took my pleasure in reading stones inscribed before the flood.\"\nSo to conclude, the languages were not mutually intelligible at all, though they were in close proximity for a very long time and borrowed freely from eachother, before Akkadian totally replaced Sumerian as the lingua franca of the region and then was replaced and diverged itself. Sumerian retained a mysticism throughout the later period, which meant its preservation by priests and scribes long after the last native Sumerian had died, even up to the capture of Babylon by Alexander the Great. It is believed that the last writers of Sumerian put down their styluses at the beginning of the Christian era.\nSources: \nUniversity courses,\nBabylon by Paul Kriwaczek, \nBetween the Rivers by the great courses\nA Descriptive grammar of Sumerian, A.

{"question": "When did historians stop viewing myths as real?\nI apologize if this is the wrong place to ask, but I'm reading *City of God* and I get the impression that Saint Augustine believes that the gods the Greeks and Romans worshipped were **actual** fallen angles and demons while at the same time acknowledging that some mythic stories (like that of Romulus) are just fictions. \nI know that today there are religious people who view the events outlined in the Abrahamic books as literal and that if you reverse times arrow that belief increases dramatically. \nThis all made me wonder when myth started to separate from history and what allowed for that trend.", "prompt_source": "AskHistorian", "details": {"submission_date": "2022-10-30 08:26:17", "submission_ID": "yhd1wz", "URL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yhd1wz/when_did_historians_stop_viewing_myths_as_real/", "comment_ID": "iudoe63", "upvote": 16, "comment_date": "2022-10-30 11:25:56", "auto_references": "\nNone.", "source": "data/original_data_collection/askHistorian_2021_2022_myscrape/2022_might_have_ref.jsonl", "human_ans": "I would say this is really complex question, maybe more philosophical than historical.\nQuestion about precise myth that was debunked at some point in history would probably give you more historical information about why this one myth was debunked.\nWith this question you are asking when myth started to separate from history, and I have more questions than answers:\nWhat is a myth in your opinion? Which myths are you referring here? Which history are you talking about? \nI will assume that you are talking about western view on history or about western history, and that you are asking when did people in western societies started to view religious stories as myths not as a scientific fact. I assume that because you are giving the example of Saint Augustine and Romulus. For this, I would give you the answer that development of science, starting in 17 century had a big impact on defining what is scientifically true. Or in your words, what is not a myth.\nAgain for more specific answer, you should ask questions about specific myth.\nBut you should not view history as something that is \"myth free\" even today. That's why I asked what is a myth in your opinion. And sometimes history is really hard to prove scientifically. Nobody today (probably) thinks that Roman and Greek goods are fallen angels. Did we prove it scientifically, that Roman gods are not fallen angels? \nAlso, history is changing. We know something today, but we can discover new thing tomorrow, and suddenly, this first thing we knew for years is now nothing more than a myth.\nIn addition, there is no \"one history to rule them all\". There are many histories, from different time periods or societies. Something that is a myth for one society, maybe is not myth for another.\nBut most importantly, history can be used as a political tool to prove, for example, how some people are better than the others. Here, you don't need to look at some distant past, you can look at something that happened 83 years ago: WW2. Myth about superiority of one human race was used as a historical fact, and we are still living with consequences of this act.\nSo, if you are talking about religious myths in western societies, development of science is your answer, and again, you should ask about specific myth for more historical answer, but I wouldn't be so sure that we can say that today there is no myths in history."}}

For example, the Vickers Mk.E Type A with two machine gun turrets was designed for trench sweeping. A tank could drive up on a trench and fire in two directions at once so enemy troops had nowhere to run. This sort of approach fell out of favour quickly since the most you could fit into one of these turrets was a very small gun (low velocity 37 mm) or a machine gun. It was also difficult to communicate with the other turret. Interestingly enough, the idea of one main turret and a small machine gun turret persisted for quite some time. The German Neubaufahrzeug, Canadian Ram, and British Crusader all had this solution. This merely gave the hull gunner more range when engaging enemy infantry. All three nations dropped the idea, since the machine gun turret turned out to be very cramped.\nDouble barreled tanks also existed but they were much rarer. The idea behind these tanks was to increase the density of fire when engaging a single target rather than engaging multiple targets like the multi-turret tanks did. The gunner could also correct his aim and make a rapid follow-up shot. This also got rid of the problem with communication, since both weapons were aimed by the same crew and they were not separated into different turrets.\nOne such vehicle was the KV-7. This vehicle was classified as an assault tank and first actually had \\*three\\* guns (one 76 mm and two 45 mm) and later modified to fit two 76 mm guns. Trials showed that volley fire didn't quite work all that well when the faster firing 45 mm guns were restricted to the lower rate of fire of the 76 mm gun. The dual 76 mm gun variant had low priority to begin with and later it turned out that the guns were difficult to operate and fire. \nThe Australians built a Sentinel tank with two 25-pounders, although it was never meant to fight. The idea behind this tank was to simulate the recoil of a 17-pounder gun (as one had not yet been delivered to Australia).\nThe most successful double barreled tank design was the Marmon-Herrington MTLS-IGI4. 145 units were built and they even saw battle. The tank was armed with two semiautomatic 37 mm guns fed with 5 round clips.\nThere were plenty of designs that remained on paper. The T-34-3 tank was a proposal similar to the KV-7 with two 45 mm and one 76 mm gun. The SU-2-122 was an SPG on the T-34 chassis with two M-30 122 mm howitzers. There was also the ST-II tank pitched in 1945. Here the rate of fire was increased by having not only double the guns, but also two loaders. These are only the ones I'm aware of and I'm sure this is not an exhaustive list.\nSources and further reading:\n* [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/04/kv-7-lock-stock-and-three-smoking.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/04/kv-7-lock-stock-and-three-smoking.html)\n* [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2020/02/the-australian-sentinel.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2020/02/the-australian-sentinel.html)\n* [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2015/12/double-barrels-from-perm.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2015/12/double-barrels-from-perm.html)\n* [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2014/08/st-ii.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2014/08/st-ii.html)"}}

It isn\u2019t totally comprehensive despite appearances; I\u2019ve generally focussed on anything that covers the origins and dynamics of these revolts as opposed to things like specific rebel agendas, the Qing response, or attempts at diplomacy.\n### Theory &amp; General Overviews\nAs I allude to in the podcast, older scholarship tends to be more materialistic on the causes and dynamics of rebellion in this period, whereas ideology and identity are more strongly foregrounded in more recent scholarship. A number of what I\u2019ll list here under the theory section will appear later on the list; they\u2019ve been included specifically because they signpost their approach relatively strongly, even if they are not overtly advancing a model or a theoretical approach.\n* Philip A.

The closest you can get is a volumes edited by Jean Chesneaux, *Popular Movements and Secret Societies in China, 1840-1950* (1972); unfortunately the English translation omits several of the 19th century-focussed articles that were in the original French edition. It is also rather old, and a good portion of the material has been superseded.\n### Taiping\nThe Taiping probably don\u2019t need much introduction from me, though their early period hasn\u2019t really been looked at in depth particularly recently. The best narrative you\u2019ll get that covers it is Jonathan Spence\u2019s *God\u2019s Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan* (1996), though a more structural view can be found in Zhang Yang\u2019s dissertation, cited above in the \u2018Theory\u2019 section. As for discussions of Taiping ideology, see:\n* Robert P. Weller, *Resistance, Chaos, and Control in China: Taiping Rebels, Taiwanese Ghosts, and Tiananmen* (1997)\n* Thomas H. Reilly, *The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Religion and the Blasphemy of Empire* (2004)\n* Carl Kilcourse, *Taiping Theology: The Localisation of Christianity in China, 1836-1864* (2017)\nMore specifically, on the matter of identity, Huan Jin has written a couple of articles lately on that precise topic:\n* \u2018Violence and the Evolving Face of Yao in Taiping Propaganda\u2019, *Journal of Religion and Violence*, 6:1 (2018), pp. 127-144\n* \u2018Multiple Otherness: Identity Politics in the Taiping Civil War\u2019, *Journal of Chinese Literature and Culture*, 7:1 (2020), pp. 215-231\nIn terms of the dynamics of the conflict in its later years and how different interests interacted, perhaps the best summary discussion is in:\n* Xiaowei Zheng, \u2018Loyalty, Anxiety, and Opportunism: Local Elite Activism during the Taiping Rebellion in Eastern Zhejiang, 1851\u20131864\u2019, *Late Imperial China*, 30:2 (2009), pp. 39-83\nOf course, it would also be remiss not to include the standard military-diplomatic account of the later period of conflict, that being \n* Stephen R. Platt, *Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom: China, the West, and the Epic Story of the Taiping Civil War* (2012)\n### Bandits and Secret Societies: The Nian (1851-68), Red Turbans (1854-6) and Small Swords (1853-5)\nThe Nian \u637b Rebellion took place in northern China, mainly in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Zhili (Hebei) and Shanxi, until 1868. Conventionally the start date is placed somewhere in the early 1850s, but the Nian as a relatively organised entity had been in existence since the 1840s, so attempting to pin a firm start date is neither possible nor productive. Generally, the Nian are seen as a bandit uprising with no clear identity-based elements, but that may be a product of the scholarship, most of which is older, and takes a relatively materialist approach. Perry\u2019s work is still basically the most recent and is most directly relevant to the issues of the rebellion\u2019s origins and dynamics, Teng\u2019s is included for completeness and for chronology:\n* Elizabeth J. Perry, \u2018Worshipers and Warriors: White Lotus Influence on the Nian Rebellion\u2019 (1976)\n* Elizabeth J. Perry, *Rebels and Revolutionaries in North China, 1845-1945* (1980)\n* Ss\u00fc-Yu Teng, *The Nien Army and their Guerrilla Warfare, 1851\u20131868* (1961)\nThe so-called \u2018Red Turban Rebellion\u2019 of 1854-6 is perhaps better understood as a particularly intense phase of a longer-term contention between secret societies like the Heaven and Earth Society, or Tiandihui \u5929\u5730\u6703, and the Qing state. The origins of the Heaven and Earth Society have been subject to great confusion: until the mid-1990s they were thought to have been founded as an anti-Manchu organisation at the start of Qing rule in the mid-late seventeenth century, but work by Dian Murray (*The Origins of the Tiandihui: The Chinese Triads in Legend and History* (1994)) has shown that they in fact started out as a mutual aid group in the 1760s, and became politically radicalised in the early 19th century, constructing a romantic, mythic past of anti-Manchu resistance in the process. It was this later Heaven and Earth Society which, capitalising on the weakening of Qing rule in South China in the midst of the Taiping conflict, attacked Guangzhou in 1854. A remnant group of the Red Turban rebels formed the Dacheng \u5927\u6210 Kingdom centred on what is now Guiping in Guangxi, and held out until 1861.

Historian Maria Caldognetto notes the 1946 report of the Italian Legate to Luxembourg where he informed Rome of the tense situation in Luxembourg and the countless sequestrations of property among fascists and non-fascists alike. The sequestration even hit those who had their property previously seized by the fascists in Italy or who had actively fought and resisted during the war. This is the case for Luigi Peruzzi, who had his property confiscated.\nPeruzzi was an anti-fascist who was deeply involved in actions against the fascist community in Luxembourg during the 1930s. The Luxembourgish government at the time repeatedly expulsed anti-fascists and was heavily criticized by the anti-fascists for doing Mussolini\u2019s bidding. In May 1940, during the evacuation of Luxembourg following the German Invasion, Peruzzi fled with his family to France. There he encountered anti-Italian sentiment because the French assumed he was fascist.\nAfter the French capitulation he returned to Luxembourg and resumed his resistance, now also against the Nazis. In 1942 he and many others were caught by the Germans and held in Prison before being moved to the SS-Sonderlager Hinzert in September of 1942. Upon arrival, the inmates were highly suspicious of him and his Italian colleagues. They too believed he was a fascist spy. It took quite some time (and a lot of torture by the Germans) to finally convince the inmates that Peruzzi was safe and on their side.\n&gt;Sidenote: Peruzzi\u2019s story during the war continues to be fascinating: After Hinzert, he\u2019s moved to Italy and held under house-arrest, then joins the Free Italian Forces, gets captured by the Germans again and forcefully deported to Berlin to work in a factory there.\nThe anti-Italian sentiment was also present among resistance fighters, including those who had known of anti-fascist Italians among their ranks. As such, in 1952 Raymond Steichen (a co-inmate who was part of the same prisoner-convoy as Peruzzi from Luxembourg to Hinzert) co-published the \u201cLivre d\u2019Or de la R\u00e9sistance\u201d (a collection of all the names of the victims of the Nazi terror among resistance fighters). Neither Peruzzi nor his other Italian colleagues are mentioned.\nEven worse, historian Denis Scuto notes that in the 1996 published book \u201cLivre d\u2019Or des Prisons\u201d (list of names of those imprisoned based on the incomplete prison register), the author (and resistance fighter) Aloyse Raths purposefully leaves out Peruzzi as ever having been imprisoned. For the convoy of the 14th of September 1942, Raths stops at Prisoner N\u00b036. Guess who prisoner N\u00b037 was, none other than Luigi Peruzzi. As such Italian antifascist resistance was still (purposefully) being ignored as late as the early 2000s.\nNow what about the rest of the Italians? Historian Vincent Artuso notes that after the war there was a massive need for foreign workers to rebuild the country and fulfil the economic needs. The government was hesitant to ask for Italian workers because they considered them as enemies. However, the government had little choice. They couldn\u2019t request German workers as the French were hoarding them and the \u201cdisplaced persons\u201d couldn\u2019t be used because they had nowhere to go to once the government no longer needed them.\nSo, the economic need and the restrictions forced the government in September of 1946 to pursue Italian workers, but only those that were specifically noted for their anti-fascist attitude. In 1948 both governments signed a deal. By 1949 relations had normalized to the point that anti-Italian sentiment was no longer as present as before. Anti-Italian sentiment was present after the war and hit the Italian community hard, but the economic needs of the country offered no other choice than to normalize relations again in order to profit of the manpower. This didn't stop the memory of anti-fascist resistance to be \"forgotten\" by the historiography.\nMaterials used:\n* Artuso, Vincent, D\u00e9i vergiessen Ausl\u00e4nner, d\u00e9i d'Land er\u00ebm opgebaut hunn, in: radio 100,7 (16.08.2020), URL: [https://www.100komma7.lu/article/wessen/dei-vergiessen-auslanner-dei-d-land-erem-opgebaut-hunn](https://www.100komma7.lu/article/wessen/dei-vergiessen-auslanner-dei-d-land-erem-opgebaut-hunn)\n* Caldognetto, Maria Luisa, L\u2019antifascisme des Italiens au Luxembourg (ann\u00e9es 1920-1940), in: Mus\u00e9e National de la R\u00e9sistance et des Droits Humains, Le Luxembourg et le Troisi\u00e8me Reich.

They fit into a literary tradition and broader western anxiety which also sees expression in writings about Barbary Slavers or the largely fictitious \u201cwhite slavers\u201d of the 20th century.\nThe Axtell paper is based on over 100 captivity narratives. But does not mention the predominant view that most such narratives are fictional or fictionalized.  The idea of colonists \u2018going native\u2019 was common, but so were dubious narratives of indigenous cannibalism.\nThese sources need to be engaged with critically, as they are often more reflective of political debate within colonial society or European assumptions about indigenous life, rather than historical realities.\nOne source which I think draws out this complexity well is:\n* Brooks, James F. Captives and cousins: Slavery, kinship, and community in the Southwest Borderlands. UNC Press Books, 2011.\nThis book illustrates many of the contours of assimilation (often echoing the conclusions of Heard\u2019s dissertation): Treatment of captives varied between different  groups and different time periods. Outcomes were shaped heavily by the age and sex of the captive, and the length of captivity. There was a wide spectrum of captive status, ranging from chattel slave to adopted family member. The intent of abduction also varied, some captives were taken to be killed or ransomed, other to provide labor or be adopted. Accordingly, some captives were subject to considerable violence and abuse, others were not.\nThe consensus from what I have read is that assimilation is determined mostly by age when captivity begins, length of captivity, and how a person is treated in captivity.\nWhereas Graeber and Wengrow try to use these literary sources as proof of the objective superiority of one culture and way of life; it seems more likely that individual treatment and local conditions determined outcomes.\nThis is not my area of primary expertise, and other flairs could provide you with a better list of recent scholarship.

Second, Aquinas never wrote that it is not a sin to harm animals 'because they do not have emotions'. And whilst the logic of Aquinas does share a portion with that of Descartes, it widely differs from who draw what from which, for while both were heavily religious, Descartes is called 'Rationalist'; and Aquinas, a saint, and a 'Theologist'.\nFinally, the trend of thoughts in philosophical history and who influenced whom is of such a vague question with following vague answers, unless the person in manner quotes or mentions another, or such paramount evidence shows he is sided with some set of ideas predecessing him.\nBeforehand, a simple example. Consider that you see a cat in front of you, trying to catch a mouse. It may adopt a 'strategy'; it may cry out when the mouse bites, or growls when things do not happen as it 'wished'. Conversly, the mouse would seem 'terrified'; it trembles and has its eyes wide; it squeaks everytime a paw or teeth passes it by a inch.\nQuestion: do they feel emotions?\nUndoubtedly, most would answer, yes.\nAnother question: it turns out that this cat and this mouse was a carefully articulated machine with bones out of metal and blood out of electricity, by the most prominent scientists. Does these machines have emotions?\nWould you still answer, yes? If not, why?\n'Animals have nerves and brains, they are 'Organisms''; but before you have opened up the body of the cat and mouse, can you tell which is a 'organism' or, merely, a 'machine'? Does it really make a difference to have bone of calcium rather than of metal, and blood of complex proteins than flow of electrons? \nOr is it, as Thomas Hobbes puts it:\n'For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principal part within, why may we not say that all automata... have an artificial life? For what is the heart, but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels, giving motion to the whole body, such as was intended by the Artificer?' - Leviathan, Introduction\nTaken all this, what is it to feel; to have emotion? Is it truly the same thing that is in matter when we scream in pain, and a dog apparently screams in pain?\nSorry for the long introduction, but the question of 'feeling' is much more complicated than we normally believe to be; and to say Descartes as dumb-da-dill donkey is to ignore the essence of such questions.\nWith this in mind, let's examine Descartes first. His most famous sentence 'I think therefore I am' or 'Cogito Ergo Sum', is the core factor for understanding his intepretation upon animals. To summarize his ideas:\n1. I am, at least, thinking properly.\n2. Yet, my senses can have errors; everything I perceive might be deceived.\n3. After reducing everything that I cannot assure to be unerronous, and false, all sensations and ideas fade away, remaining only the mind itself.\n4. Therefore, the essence of my being is not material; but it is the thinking me, the one that makes the verb cogitas to cogito: the rational soul.\n5. Further, I have the idea of God, the perfection in every way that I am defect of; and certainly I cannot derive myself independently, for if I was the sole reason of my existance, I would not feel any defects in myself. Therefore, God exists; and whilst his infiniteness assures his self-existance, I am surely his creation, owing my existance and all rational faculties to him.\n6. That my essence is solely determined by the fact that I am a thinking being is thus evident. But the sensations and perceptions which is surely not of immortal, indivisible soul's aspect, alongside with a clear idea of my bodily existance, makes me believe there does exist a body and an external world; and since God is not deceitful, it is most certain that my body exist, and the external world also.\n7. Whilst body and soul is of such difference, they interact, and the bodily sensations sometimes create errors; and the thinking upon experience and free will also have errors; thus man's life are full of mischief; yet still, it is no mean for the finite to blame the creator for his imperfection; rather, I thank God for everything he has blessed upon me.\nThis is called mind-body dualism; specifically, Cartesian dualism. And as you can see, the key point in human is not its machine-like body(Descartes specifically says that the natural body is no more than a machine articulated by God) but its rational soul. And while the two components are distinct, they are so closely united and casually interact with each other, as we see, hear, feel, enjoy, and weep:\n'it is not sufficient for it(the soul) to be lodged in the human body like a pilot in his ship, except perhaps to move its members, but that it needs to be more closely joined and united with the body in order to have, in addition,  feelings and appetites like the ones we have, and in this way compose a true man.'\nThus here is the core of problem: if we are to say animals feel as we do, we must assert that they have the soul as we do.\nHe of course denies this for the following factors:\n1. Language and sign usage in a complex manner is essential to humans and humans alone; a machine would never imitate above simple utterance according to programmed ways.\nSince animals have such many organs corresponding to us, if they had mental capabilities then they will be able to and would communicate with us as all rational souls will, they fail to do so; thus, their apparent 'communications' and 'emotions' are but machinary.\n2. Whilst human reason is a universal tool upon any matter, animals show that their abilities, while some being much superior to humans, fail to show such universialness beyond its designated designs; the purpose of that particular machinary.\n'Rather, it shows that they have no mental powers whatsoever, and that it is nature which acts in them, according to the disposition of their organs; just as we see that a clock consisting only of ropes and springs can count the hours and measure time more accurately than we can in spite of all our wisdom.'\nThus, he does not claim that there is no reaction which is seemingly an emotion felt by animals; for their bodies are just like our material bodies, a machine. Yet they lack the most important factor distinguishing human above all else; the rational, thinking soul: therefore, in this sense, they cannot feel.\nI strongly suggest that you read the Discourse on Methods and Meditations on First Philosophy.\nAll sources, except from Leviathan, is from these two books.

I feel that you're asking two things: 1. Where does language come from \u2013 how do we give names to things and 2. How do people know what gender nouns are? I'm just going to focus on the second, because the first is almost impossible to answer.\nFirst of all, it's important to understand that what we call *grammatical gender* is a type of noun class. Noun classes group nouns based on certain characteristics. One of these can be gender, but in some languages, you find noun categorization along different characteristics. These can be things like whether the noun's referent (meaning the thing it refers to in the real world) is alive or not, i.e., animacy. In Dyirbal (a language spoken in Northern Australia) there are noun classes based on things like whether the noun's referent is alive or not, edible or not, dangerous and not, and so on. Nouns whose referent is biologically male or female fall into different categories \u2013 hence the title of George Lakoff's book *Women, Fire and Other Dangerous Things*.\nSo let's talk about grammatical gender. Nowadays, most linguists who deal with grammatical gender would say we can only speak of grammatical gender when the noun classes are defined along a sex-based divide. It's important to realize that less than half of the world's languages have sex-based grammatical gender; it's kind of a coincidence that some of the largest languages, such as English\\*, Spanish, French, Russian and Arabic (to name a few) have sex-based noun class systems. \nIn almost all of these languages, as far as I know, there are different strategies to assign grammatical gender to a noun. Most importantly, whether or not the noun's referent has a biologically male or female counterpart. There are no sex-based gendered languages (that I'm aware of) that assign masculine gender to nouns with a female referent and vice versa. This is what we call *semantic gender assignment*\nAt this point there is usually some wise guy who'd say \"Ah! But what about German *M\u00e4dchen*! It's *das* \\[neuter\\] *M\u00e4dchen,* not *die* \\[feminine\\] *M\u00e4dchen!*\". And they'd be right. This brings me to the second important way of assigning gender to nouns, i..e, what kind of sound(s) the noun ends on. This is what we call *morphophonological gender assignment*.  Basically this means that the ending of a noun (in this case German diminutive *-chen*) can override our \"logical\" understanding of its gender. But it gets more complex. There are few German speakers who would say *Das M\u00e4dchen, es ist sch\u00f6n* i..e, \"The girl, it is beautiful\" (although this is historically more common). More often, they would refer to back to the neuter noun with *sie*, (\"she\"). \nThese two strategies are the most important as to deciding gender. A lot of people, both lay linguists as well as language enthusiasts feel that gender assignment is random. This is untrue. For the vast majority of nouns in languages with sex-based grammatical gender, there are patterns that are rather strict. Learning these patterns might be difficult, and sometimes certain nouns have undergone such sound changes that finding these underlying patterns are very difficult. \nIn the case of Indo-European languages, it is generally thought that the masculine-feminine divide originally came from an animate-inanimate distinction. I've not done a lot of Indo-European linguistics, but if I remember correctly, at some point animate split up into a masculine and feminine distinction, and inanimate turned into neuter. Then, in some Indo-European languages the old inanimate disappeared, and some (like Baltic) only maintained a masculine-feminine distinction.\nIn short, depending on where our ancient friend might be living, they'd have different strategies of deciding whether or not a noun is masculine, feminine, neuter, or maybe something else. \nFor further reading, I'd suggest: \n&amp;#x200B;\n1.

Thomas Edison famously invented the electric chair and once killed an elephant with AC current as a demonstration in the \"current wars\" he eventually lost to Westinghouse.\nI hate to argue with a flair, but Edison himself almost certainly had nothing to do with that.\nTopsy was a horribly abused elephant, even by the weak standards of humane animal treatment of the time, and lashed out, killing a man (actually the third man she killed overall). She was condemned to death the next day, and Luna Park wanted to make a public spectacle of it, purely for the profit it would bring. They originally planned to hang her, but changed their mind and went for electrocution.\nThe electricity came from the Edison Electric Luminating Company of Brooklyn. Topsy was fed poison, a rope was placed around her neck, and two legs were fitted with electrodes. Technicians from the electric company closed the circuit, and Topsy fell over, dead, a few seconds later.\nThere is no evidence that Edison knew anything about it, as he never spoke of it and doesn't seem to have written about it, and he was not mentioned in newspaper reports of the time. Edison's name appeared on the names of many electric companies nationally as a result of licensing his methods of generation. That his name appeared on the company involved here was sheer coincidence.\nTopsy died in 1903. The War of the Currents ended in the 1890s. Topsy was the victim of abuse and spectacle, not of Edison trying to prove Westinghouse wrong.\nSources:\n* [Myth-Buster: Topsy the Elephant](https://edison.rutgers.edu/life-of-edison/essaying-edison/essay/myth-buster-topsy-the-elephant), Essaying Edison, Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences\n* [Topsy the Elephant Was a Victim of Her Captors, Not Thomas Edison](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/topsy-elephant-was-victim-her-captors-not-really-thomas-edison-180961611/), Kat Eschner, Smithsonian Magazine"}}
